title: working on my christmas list
---

i really want this book:

[mac os x internals: a systems approach][1]

it looks really cool. i also want this:

[vmware fusion][2]

i have the trial version, so i set up an ubuntu virtual machine. i set it
to full screen, then put it on one of my virtual desktops, so all i have
to do is switch to a different desktop and i am in a new operating system.
coolness.
