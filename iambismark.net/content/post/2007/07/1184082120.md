weighed myself yesterday after working out. 188 lbs. last time i weighed
myself before going to japan, i was 174 lbs. and remember, i have been
home for two weeks now and i have been working out 3 times a week since
then. i was most likely 190+ when i first got home. thank you home stay
moms for loving me so much. plus it gives me more motivation to work out.
not that there are any cute girls at the pool anyway..
