so, i am curious as to who actually reads this.

over 50% of my page views come from provo. not surprising i suppose since
thats where the most people actually know of bismark.

another 14% comes from along the wasatch front. again, not too surprising.

outside of utah, the highest number of hits comes from the san francisco
bay area. i bet most of those are molecularbond.

outside of that, there are some interesting ones.

someone in las vegas visited here three times with an average time on site
of twelve minutes! that beats out the second highest average time by nine
minutes!

someone in rochester MN has been reading this. i can't think of who
i could possible know there.

i have six hits from wisconsin, though none of them show up as baraboo.
where is the love goda?

who in the world do i know in indiana, ohio, and maryland?

well, much love dear readers. leave a comment, give me a shout out.
