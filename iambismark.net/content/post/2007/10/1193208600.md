i just realized that i've never been asked to a preference dance. now,
i realize of course that preference dances are usually totally lame and no
one goes anyway, but still, it caused me to pause and think. why would
this be the case? perhaps all this time of me telling myself that i have
a chance with a large number of women if i would just put in the effort
was just wishful thinking? maybe the reason i don't date often is not
merely just failing to go out to meet girls i am interested, but girls
actively avoiding contact with me. i am being a bit tongue in cheek here,
though perhaps readers should correct me if i should take this more
seriously.

ok, now this is not a request for any invitations to preference this
weekend. nothing is trumping the leopard release party. plus i hate
dressing up. ok, maybe these are reasons i've never been asked.
