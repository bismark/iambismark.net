title: intriguing. yet a little awkward.
---

so, i got a very interesting phone call last night somewhat related to
this [this][1]. i'm kind of glad i was in the middle of high school
musical (ok, don't ask) and just let it go to voice mail. i returned the
voice mail just now, and of course it might be completely unrelated, but
it was a little unexpected.
