ryan's vice #382: little debbie fudge brownies.

i really wanted one, so i went down to the vending machines to get one.
i pressed the numbers, and the little display said "Malfunction with that
product." i was pretty upset about that. then i went to a vending machine
two down from the usual brownie machine, and lo and behold, there were the
brownies! hurray! but the drink machine was out of skim milk.. sigh.
