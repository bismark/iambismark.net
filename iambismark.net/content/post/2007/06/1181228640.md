mister donut rocks my world. they are having a 100 yen sale right now, and
there is one right outside of the train station i get off the train at.
i swear, the japanese have never invented anything as amazing as the pon
de ring donuts. its this soft, squishy donut, almost with the consistency
of mochi, and it is hella good.

sigh.. i need to get into the weight room...
