freshman year story time. kids used to make out in the lobbies of DT...
A LOT. it was a bit obnoxious, so a couple of buddies and i made a group
on facebook called the anti-making out in DT lobbies league. we were
pretty proud of it, and a ton of people joined. i even heard some other
kids sitting in the cafeteria trying to make fun of us in order to justify
their PDAs or something. anyway, one night we decided to make a stand.
i typed up the following sign.

after going to the creamery and buying milk and licorice (i don't know
what that has to do with the story, i just know that we were carrying it
around), we made our way around all of the lobbies of the complex and
posted on of these signs in them. we got a number of dirty looks,
especially from the making out couple that we posted the sign right above.
it was all grand fun. the next morning the sign was gone from our lobby,
but to our great delight, one of the signs stayed up for almost a week!
