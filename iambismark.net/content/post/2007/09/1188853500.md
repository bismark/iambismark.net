i was listening to a piece on senator larry craig on NPR last night, and
I started thinking about some things. in no way will i defend the man and
his actions. but I have a question. a lot of people are calling hypocrisy
because senator craig, who appears to have some homosexual tendencies,
voted against extending rights to homosexuals on various occasions. but
aren't senators supposed to represent their constituents? and if his
constituents voted him into office under the expectation that he would
vote in such a way, isn't he doing the right thing by voting that way
instead of by his personal convictions?
