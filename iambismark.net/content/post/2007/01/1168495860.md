i have a speaking part. for anyone who knows the play, i am ambrose, the
guy who dolly (as in hello dolly) is helping to get married. at least
thats what i think the story is. to be honest, i really don't know.

why do we do things we know we shouldn't? i've seen it both in my life and
in those nearby. out of some morbid sense of curiosity, we do something
that is only going to hurt us. i don't know.
