title: welcome to provo
---

first day back in provo. went back to work. woo. i went for a run tonight.
it felt really good. just a 3+ miles.. nothing big. time to get rid of
those mission-esque love handles that started sneaking back over the
break...

i found myself throwing up my outside arm for leverage, lowering my head,
and surging through a tight corner... gosh... no better way to break
someones will than by suddenly being three steps further ahead of him once
he gets around the corner.. i loved racing...

ITOTD (interesting thing of the day): lately i have had a lot of street
lamps just suddenly turn off while i was walking/running under them. at
least 5 or 6 in the past month or so. weird, huh? i have a few theories:

1. i am such a cheery and bright person so my glowing personality makes
the lamp think its daytime.
2. i am surrounded by an aura of evil darkness that drowns out all light.

the second one sounds pretty cool actually. all will succumb my evil aura
of darkness!
