title: protests over the da vinci code...

just some thoughts: i think the whole thing is kind of silly. i guess as
a mormon, i really have no issues with jesus have married or having
children. it has always been one of those "maybe but who knows" type of
things in church, so i really doubt there can be any latter-day saints who
would be upset over some of the messages in this film. and it's almost as
if they took the whole covering up of events and missing scriptures
straight out of a sunday school lesson on the apostasy.

i think this uproar is even less justified than the muslim protests over
the cartoons of mohammed. i mean, it's not as if the book/film makes fun
of christ. it merely questions some oft held beliefs. a pretty silly thing
to be upset about.

and while i'm on the subject, the lds church did ask hbo to put
a disclaimer at the end of their polygamy show, but i think there is a big
difference there. people who watch the show could easily think that
mormons still practice polygamy from what they see. but i really doubt
anyone is going to go up to a christian after this movie and say "oh, hey,
you are the ones who believe jesus got married." i dunno. it just seems
like a whole lot of nothing to get riled up over.
