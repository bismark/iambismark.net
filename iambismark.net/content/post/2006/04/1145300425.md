title: 'things i don''t like today:'
---

- cold showers in the morning
- utah spring weather not being able to figure out if it wants to be hot
  or cold
- the vending machine where i can buy brownies being out of order
- dorks who don't like my dancing at the divine comedy show. high school
  is over, douche bags.

and i guess i will be positive and say what is good:

- no homework for the rest of the semester
- for most of my finals, i only need around a 60% to get an A
- my ingenious use of a newspaper to cover up the freezing cold air vents in
our office continues to be a hit, and my boss is considering putting the
product out for general consumption
