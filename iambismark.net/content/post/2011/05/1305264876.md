Hi again.

I'm going to start writing again.  I am tired of just being a consumer,
it's time to start producing again (more on that later).

Things are going well.  Mariam and I had a nice relaxing vacation for two
weeks in Mexico (though we did pick up something that's doing nasty stuff
to our digestive tracks... yes, we are getting it checked out).  Work is
good; I leveled up this last quarter, which is a nice star on my resume
plus added responsibility.  Which I like.

So yeah, life is good.
