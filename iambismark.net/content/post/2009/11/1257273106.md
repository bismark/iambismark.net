title: props to ebillme
---

i just want to give a big thanks to the folks at [ebillme][1]. it's
a pretty cool service; basically it's a way to make direct check/debit
transactions over the internet without needing to enter a debit card
number. they use your bank's online bill pay system.

but anyway, back in july i found a sweet deal on [zipzoomfly.com][2] for
a eeepc netbook for mariam to use. it was $169 with a $30 rebate if i paid
with using ebillme. $139 was pretty tough to pass up, so i went ahead and
got it for her.

well, now four months later, i still haven't gotten my rebate. but unlike
most of the scammy rebate people who would have not cared if i got it or
not, ebillme just called to follow up with me and got my new address in
their system so they could send the rebate check to the right place.
awesome, props to them for that great service.
