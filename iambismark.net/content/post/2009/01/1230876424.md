title: bring it on new year
---

well, hello 2009. and i thought 2008 was going to be an exciting year...
but yeah, lets talk about 2008 first. it was pretty crazy. i did **a
lot**. just off the top of my head:

- moved to california
- bought a car
- worked at intel
- started an 8 month relationship
- took the GRE
- returned to provo
- started my senior year of college
- applied to grad schools
- ended the 8 month relationship
- went to seattle
- got a new niece
- etc etc etc

i loved my time in california. i look back at it all quite quite fondly.
it was amazing to be out on my own, with a car, money and free time.
i kind of wish i was getting ready to go back there in two days instead of
provo. i remember my first week in sacramento, trying to sleep on my air
mattress surrounded by my boxes of stuff. we had no internet so i borrowed
some movies from my mentor at work.. crazy chinese and japanese films.
eating my first chipotle burrito.. going to the dances and not knowing
anyone at all.. going to tahoe with some friends i had made and loving the
scenery and snowshoeing. hard to believe that was all a year ago. here are
some photos that i wanted to share:

some pics from my final week at intel.

i miss it. and of course all of those who have read this blog know all of
the other things that happened. i could write tons about my california
adventure (and i probably someday wish i would have), and even more about
my relationship starting and ending. i think i will let that subject rest
for the most part in the past now.

and now for a review of my [resolutions][10] from last year:

- "_make everything i can out of this internship. learn a ton, experience
  a ton, make a ton, and enjoy a ton._"

i would give this a big yes. i loved my time at intel, and the more i look
back on it, the more valuable it seems.

- "_be more friendly and outgoing. i am moving to a new city and state
  where i know no one. i really want to make some good friends._"

i think i did pretty well. i had a bit of a reset as far as my group of
friends about two months into things, but i still feel like i had a great
social life in sacramento. 

- "_get in good shape. i have been away from the weight room for over
  a month now with sickness, finals, etc., and i can feel it. time to get
  back._"

yeah i totally failed at this one. i paid about $60 a month for
a membership at california family fitness the whole time i was in
sacramento. i started off well, loving the kickboxing and cycling classes
and getting in for lifting pretty often. but things just went down the
tubes. i am pretty sure right now i am in the worse shape i have ever been
in. 

- "_stop being afraid to fall in love. who knows if it will happen or not,
  but i at least want to allow myself to have it happen._"

well, i think i passed. like i said, i could write a ton, but i won't.
i learned a lot. love is a good thing, even though it hurts sometimes.

and now for this year. oh gosh, i'm scared. at the time of this writing,
in a little under four months, i have absolutely no idea what i am going
to be doing with my life. i have no idea where i will live. i have no idea
what i will do for work. i have no idea if i will be continuing my
education. nothing. i've never had something like this before. i've always
known what was coming next and what i planned to do. i think this will be
good for me.

here is what i hope happens this year:

- get into a graduate school (first choice is UC-berkeley).
- get a summer internship that is stimulating and fun.
- fall in love again.

some of those i have more control over than others...

lets resolve some things:

- rock my last semester of undergraduate work. i am not looking forward to
  some of my courses, but i know i can do hard things.
- find a job/internship. it doesn't matter what happens with grad school,
  i need to find something that i can love to do.
- get in %$#^#$@^$-$%##^$ing shape. mariam and i have already resolved to
  start running around the track together. this year its happening.
- just be the best person i can be. i know that sounds vague, but i think
  that more than worrying about relationships and all of that, i need to
  just be a great person myself. i've got plenty of issues i need to deal
  with, and i think that once i do, love will just be natural.

ok, so, nothing too out of the ordinary, but i think i've got
plenty on my plate this year as it is. a year from now i could be working
on a masters degree, in great shape, and madly in love. or i could be
working in a burger joint, overweight, and all alone in the world. who
knows, but i'm excited to find out. bring it on 2009.
