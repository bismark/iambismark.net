so if you haven't noticed, i haven't been posting any new pictures on my
blog lately. a few weeks before i left sacramento, i dropped my iphone
while getting out of the car. the phone worked fine, but there were a few
nasty gashes on the back, including across the camera lens. this sadly
made all of the pictures i took look like the lens was covered in
vaseline. here are two examples from when i was in utah:

{{< image 1 >}}mariam coming up from a cave{{< /image >}}

this is mariam coming out of a cave we found while hiking in rock canyon.

{{< image 2 >}}red lobster virgin drinks{{< /image >}}

this is cory and laura enjoying good times at RL.

so, as you can see, the pics look all blurry. i didn't like taking
pictures with my phone anymore because it bugged me so much. when i got
here to madison, i did some searching around until i found [this site][3].
they sell various iphone parts, so i ordered a new lens piece. it arrived
today, so using the [super useful guides][4] from ifixit, i opened up my
phone and replaced the lens. it was pretty freaking scary, but i got
everything apart and back together without any leftover screws.

here is a picture where you can kind of make out the scratch on the lens.
hurray for a having a working camera once more!
