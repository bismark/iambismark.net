title: "You Can't Take It With You"
type: link
---

after graduation, i started thinking a lot more about money and goals.
yeah, i know i should have done that much earlier (but hey, now i've got
a few more years before real life here in grad school) but it has
definitely made me think about my life much differently. just as a small
example: i haven't spent a single cent on any sort of clothing in the last
4 months. i just haven't seen the need. every time i think "hmm, i really
could use a new pair of dress pants," i remind myself that i already have
what i need. anyone who cares about me wearing the same pair of pants to
church this week as i did last week is someone that i really don't care
about pleasing that much.

anyway, today there is a post on one of my new favorite blogs,
[thesimpledollar.com][1] that really hit home with me. the blogger, trent,
talks about how he watched a classic movie called "you canâ€™t take it with
you" and what it made him think about. his feelings seem to match almost
exactly the way i have started thinking in recent months so i recommend
that you go read it now.
