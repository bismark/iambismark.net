title: trip to wisconsin
---

as you all probably know, i've been accepted to the computer science
masters program at the university of wisconsin. i flew out last weekend to
check out the school. it was actually really exciting, and some of the
systems research they are doing looks awesome (for example [this][1]).
united almost kept me from getting there by canceling my flight last
minute, but my mom saved the day and helped me with a $750 last minute
ticket on southwest. it was worth it. i also got to hang out with my good
friend aaron and with my parents, which was nice. here are some pics from
the tour of the state capitol:
