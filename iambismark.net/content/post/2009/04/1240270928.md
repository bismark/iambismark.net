zuihitsu (随筆), roughly translated as "follow the brush," is
a free-flowing, personal essay. the first zuihitsu was written by [Sei
Shōnagon][1] back in 11th century heian period kyoto. for my japanese
class this semester, we wrote three zuihitsu in response to the works of
literature we were reading. to be honest, i loved doing them. usually
i hate writing essays. we also had to write two analytical essays for the
class and both were just torture. this [post][2] that i sent after
finishing my senior project final report sums up my feelings on literary
analysis essays pretty well: 

> writing technical documents isn't all that bad. none of the "how can
> I BS about this without repeating myself to fill all five pages?!"

anyway, the zuihitsu were a completely different story. i approached them
almost like blog posts, and i went away from each of them with a much
greater appreciation for the story i was responding to. they were fun to
write. i am going to post the three zuihitsu i wrote for the class on my
blog, and i plan to continue writing them for all the books/movies/etc
that i consume from now on. i hope you enjoy reading them as much as
i enjoyed and will enjoy writing them.
