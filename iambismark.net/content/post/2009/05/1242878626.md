wednesday we left a little later than i had wanted cuz we slept in and had
to pack the car for the upcoming week. we left the bay area around 11 am
and started heading east into the central valley. lots of orchards and
farms. it was actually a pretty nice drive.

i really had no idea what to expect from yosemite. i don't think i had
ever even seen a picture (well, probably had, just hadn't realized it). we
paid the entrance fee, and started a downward descent. we were surrounded
by forrest then went into a tunnel. as soon as we came out the other end,
bam, one of the most amazing views i've ever seen.

> made it to yosemite. pretty awesome.

this is one time that the iphone camera just couldn't cut it. the view of
the opening of the valley and bridalvale falls was breathtaking. on the
way down to the valley floor, we stopped at another waterfall and climbed
out onto some rocks right next to the drop off. adam has those photos and
sadly hasn't posted them anywhere (HINT!). we walked up the base of
bridavale falls and got pretty wet. i also got a strange voicemail from
the anti-fraud division of my bank then. apparently they didn't believe me
that i was actually moving to sacramende. weird. we parked down on the
valley floor and did some hiking.

i really wanted to hike to the top of the falls, but it's a six hour
roundtrip hike, so it wasn't possible. someday. honestly i could spend
weeks there hiking. someday i want go backpacking in the granite
highlands. adding that to my list of goals. we did a small hike around the
the edge of the valley and came head to head with a deer. i guess it was
pretty used to humans because it just kept walking towards us. it didn't
go off the path until i started walking towards it with my hands spread
out in the air to make me look big. we grabbed a late lunch at the grill
at the main lodge area. i checked my final byu grades while eating.

[6:23 PM Apr 29th][4]:

> final byu gpa: 3.85. meh, should have been better. VHDL classes killed
> me. this is why I'm going over to CS.

after eating, we decided to get back on the road. my dad looked up motel
room info for us while we got my car battery jumped (left the lights after
going through the tunnel...whoops).

this was our last view of the valley as we drove out. el capitan to the
left, bridalvale falls to the right. beautiful. the drive down to fresno
and onto the five was pretty uneventful, except for adam feeling a bit
sick from me taking the curvy roads too quick.

[9:31 PM Apr 29th][5]:

> quick restroom and stretch break. about 90 miles north of Bakersfield.
> stopping there for the night.
 
let me just say, there were some really really smelly places along that
road. i dunno if it was chemical plants or garbage dumps, but there were
a few places i was choking. we finally arrived in bakersfield and got
a room at motel 6. we were both looking forward to a good nights sleep
after a long day of driving.

[11:06 PM Apr 29th][6]:

> made it to Bakersfield. seedy hotel room, but it's a place to sleep.
