title: well, i graduated
---

yup, in case any of you missed that whole thing, i am now a college
graduate [_instead of "not a college graduate" as i had originally
wrote... whoops, that's kind of ironic_]! hurray! actually since i'm
headed back to school in just four months it doesn't really feel all that
special. anyway, the whole graduation process was kinda wild and crazy.
i went to finish up my last final at byu, only to be greeted by this:

yeah having to stand in line for an hour and a half just to get inside the
testing center didn't help. nor did the fact that the air conditioners
weren't working. but even after not trying too hard on the final, i still
got a B+ in the class! wednesday evening my parents and my sister's family
were all in town so i went to spend some time with them at a cabin we had
rented up in sundance. my grandparents and other sister showed up the next
day, so it was a lot of fun having the whole crew there. thursday was the
commencement. here are some silly pics:

as usual the ceremony itself dragged on way too long. the alumni
association dude's speech was total fluff and elder nelson's speech was
nice but superfluous. president uchtdorf's was pretty good though. they
kept telling us to turn off our cellphones, [but][6] [as][7] [you][8]
[can][9] [see][10], [i][11] [didn't][12] [listen][13] [to][14] [that][15]
[sillyness][16] [one][17] [bit][18]. after that was done we had a pizza
and games night with everyone at the cabin. friday was convocation, which
was just as drawn out.

i got a nice case for my degree. even though i was 99% sure i had passed
all of my classes, the fact that i didn't get an actual degree made me
kind of nervous. i feel a bit better now that i see that i passed all of
my classes, but still... i want the degree in my hand! the rest of the
weekend was spent doing family time, packing up my stuff, and saying
goodbye. saturday night i went out with mariam, ariel, michelle, kenji,
and laura to the RL for one last go. we had laughs and reminiscing all
around. i'm still waiting for the goodbye pics from michelle (HINT).

by monday morning most everyone had gone and both adam and i were packed.
the parents took us out for breakfast, we loaded up my car, and that was
the end of an era. after a few stops to prep for the trip ahead, i drove
out of provo for the last time. i think i will save waxing nostalgic for
another time. it was a good run though. on to bigger and better things.
