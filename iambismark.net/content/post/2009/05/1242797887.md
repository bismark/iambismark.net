so the monday after i graduated, my little brother and i packed up my car
and set out on a journey. the next seven days were spent on the road,
seeing some of the most amazing places in the southwestern united states.

here we are, all ready to set out.

> pulling out from Provo. goodbye.
 
leaving provo for the last time felt pretty weird. we topped of the oil,
filled up the tires with air, and bought an ipod charger to provide us
music on the road. as soon as we hit tooele, adam fell asleep
(unsurprisingly). i woke him back up as we started entering the salt
flats, and he announced that he needed to use the restroom. well, i told
him tough luck. thankfully we made it to the rest stop.

here i am at the bonneville salt flats. it was pretty windy and there was
actually a lot of standing water. we topped off the gas at wendover and
kept moving. we stopped in elko for lunch and ate [here][5].

> eating lunch in elko. didn't feel like fast food so trying a mexican

i thought it was decent, i actually liked their salsa w/ cabbage in it.
didn't expect much for the middle of nevada though.

[5:21 PM Apr 27th][7]:

> oh battle mountain.
 
[7:28 PM Apr 27th][8]:

> 4 hours till our destination according to google maps.
 
adam drove us to reno, where we got in-n-out burgers. the more i have
them, the more i think they are overrated. i mean, yeah, they are decent
for fast food burgers, but they aren't _great_.

[8:07 PM Apr 27th][9]:

> went down about 3 mpg across Nevada because of the strong head winds :(
 
i took over the driving from there. it was the a long, dark drive over the
sierras, across the central valley, and into concord.

[10:33 PM Apr 27th][10]:

> hi again Sacramento. I'll be back soon!
 
we got in around midnight, and i was pretty sick of driving. if i only
i knew what was ahead of us.

[12:02 AM Apr 28th][11]:

> made it to concord. I'm ready for a nice night of sleep.
