My operating systems professor just sent out an email with feedback for
a presentation we gave on Wednesday. It included comments from other
students.  One of them was "awesome!!" which I had jokingly written down
on the feedback form.

Well, I thought that was funny, so I hit "reply all", removed my
professor's email address from the "to" field so it would just go to my
team members, and said "haha that was me".

Apparently my iPhone decided to put my professors email in the CC field
also.
