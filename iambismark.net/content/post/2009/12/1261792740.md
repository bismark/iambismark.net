Not exactly the kind of scenery I expected to see in Mexico.  This is up
in the mountains on Mariam's grandpa's farm. We took a really nice hike
through the forest, and if it weren't for all the agave plants and the
fact that it was December 25, I could have sworn we were hiking through
northern California or Utah.
