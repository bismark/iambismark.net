title: My Avatar review
---

Ok obviously I'm a bit behind, but I finally saw avatar tonight. It was
definitely an entertaining movie. A few thoughts:

- This was my first "Real-D" 3D movie. A few hours later my eyes still
  feel a bit strained, but it made it a very fun experience. Hopefully
  that technology will get better soon. 

- The story was basic and predictable, but not terrible. This was really
  what I wanted the prequel Star Wars to be: a technical masterpiece with
  an entertaining plot. Oh how far we have come since JarJar Binks.

- Holy crap it was hot in that theater. Completely unrelated to the film
  but jeeze I was burning up. 

- It had an unabashed anti-war, pro-tree-hugging message, something which
  I certainly feel sympathetic to. Sadly the marketing of the movie is
  likely a small ecological disaster in and of itself. Maybe enjoying the
  film in a non-climate controlled theater was my way of giving back...

Anyway, the film was good. Still hard to believe a lot of what I saw was
CGI. Go see it if you have not. Try 3d if you have decent intestinal
fortitude.
