at least until i screw something up again... sorry for this mess... this
is what i get for tinkering so much with my blog... anyway, so it looks
like subscribers are still subscribed, however, some older feed links seem
to have a big delay! so, the safest bet is to just subscribe directly to
this feed:

that should always be right, no matter how badly i screw things up.
