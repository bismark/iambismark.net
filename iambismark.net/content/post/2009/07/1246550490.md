a good read on a tough topic.

homosexuality and LDS theology is a sticky topic and just not one i feel
like pulicly tackling ever on my blog. however i want to share this link
to an editorial written by my acquaintance austin smith. we were partners
for a technical writing project and we both participated in the byu peace
rally in april 2007. anyway, i feel he gives an important perspective.
