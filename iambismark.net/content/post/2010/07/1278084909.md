title: Pancakes
---

When I was a kid, whenever it was dad's turn to cook dinner, he always
made breakfast food (eggs, sausage, pancakes, etc).  Given this strong
tradition of breakfast food for dinner in the Johnson family, when I saw
this [pancake post][1] on Salt and Fat, I knew it would make a perfect
Sunday evening meal.

The sad truth is, I don't think I've ever made pancakes from scratch all
on my own, so this actually was a good learning experience.

Here are all of the ingredients put together.  Simple enough for me to
understand.

{{< image 2 >}}Melting butter{{< /image >}}

The recipe called for melted butter, but we don't have a microwave so this
is the best I could do.

All the dry stuff.

And now the wet.

And here is one cooking away.  We had a big box of blueberries, so adding
them seemed like a perfect idea, though there almost wasn't enough to add
to the pancakes towards the end because I kept eating them. Seriously, is
there a more awesome fruit in existence?

This was a special surprise for Mariam (she was in the other room reading
the whole time).

And here is the final product.  Yes, I know I need to work on my
presentation skills a bit (this looks no where near as nice as Jim Ray's
photo).  And yes, that is turkey bacon. I know, I know, very ironic to
follow a recipe from *Salt* and *Fat* and then serve turkey bacon, but
sometimes the wife wins at the super market.

It was definitely worth it.

Actually, the pancakes were not all that amazing. They ended up being
a little too dense and not as fluffy as I would have liked.  If anyone has
any ideas as to why that may be, please let me know!
