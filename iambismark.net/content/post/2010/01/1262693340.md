Mariam and I enjoying tamales on New Year's Eve. After everyone stuffed
themselves, it was a pretty subdued party. I think most of us would have
just napped through the new year had Mariam's aunt's dogs not started
going crazy with the fireworks and gunshots at midnight. It certainly was
nice to finally have someone to kiss to bring in the new year. Definitely
the right way to start things off.
