My flight out of Monterrey was delayed, so all of the scant eating
locations outside of security here in the Houston airport were closed by
the time I arrived (trust me, I looked). My flight to Milwaukee was not
for another 8 hours, so the thought of zero sustenance for the whole night
seemed rather unpleasant. Once again my iPhone came to the rescue:
I loaded up dominos.com, ordered a medium pizza to the airport hotel
lobby, and waited. 30 minutes later and I was enjoying my dinner.  Now
it's time to enjoy a long night with a full belly on a hard airport chair.
