I find it a bit ironic that Harry Reid was lambasted in the Daily
Unifarce's Reader's Forum and now multiple students are proposing Mitt
Romney for the "Mormon of the Year" award.  The most common criticism of
Harry Reid was his comments on Proposition 8. Perhaps those submitting
Romney's name should know what one Massachusetts anti gay marriage group
thinks about their former governor.
