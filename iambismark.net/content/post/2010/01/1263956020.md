title: What your blogging platform says about you
---

Livejournal: You have been blogging since before it was cool and you
probably like fanfiction.

Blogger: You don't care if your blog looks butt ugly and you haven't moved
on from 2005.

Wordpress: You think that SEO actually works.

Tumblr: You desperately want other people to think you are hip and
a design snob.

Moveable Type: You are a masochist.
