So, Tianna was kind enough to do the research [I should have done][1] and
pointed me to the [info page on the Even More Plus plans][2]. Looks like
you *do not* need a contract for a $79.99 plan with unlimited minutes,
texts, and data. A 500 minutes Even More Plus plan is $59.99 (which gives
you the equivalent of what comes along with the subsidized Nexus One). The
math turns out to be:

- $529 unsubsidized phone + $59.99 plan x 24 months = $1968.76  
- $179 subsidized phone + $79.99 plan x 24 months = $2098.76  
- Difference = $130

There *is* an incentive to getting the unsubsidized phone.  Kudos to
T-Mobile for doing something cool (Do the other carries have something
similar??) and I suppose also for making me look like an idiot!
