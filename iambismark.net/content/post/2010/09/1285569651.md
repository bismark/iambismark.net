Just one last post about moving: I am so sick of it.  Honestly, I really
wish this tiny studio apartment would be enough for me for the rest of my
life so I never have to see another cardboard box again.  Let's recap the
last eight (eight!) years of my life:

- Provo MTC
- Kiryu
- Ageo
- Takaoka
- Nasu
- Kamagaya
- Kawagoe
- Baraboo
- Deseret Towers
- Helaman Halls
- Baraboo
- Carriage Cove\*
- University Villa
- Wyview\*
- Kyoto
- Yokohama
- Cinammon Tree
- Provo House
- Sacramento\*
- Provo House #2\*
- Sacramento
- Madison House
- Eagle Heights
- Excelsior District
- Mission District

Twenty four places in the last eight years.  The ones with the * are the
locations I lived for 8 months, the longest continuous length of time
spent in any one place.  I am *really* sick of moving.  Our current lease
is for a year, so we shall see what happens.
