title: Multiple posts from me
---

I have had a couple of people complain about getting repeated blogs posts
from me today, and if this includes you, make sure you are not subscribed
to multiple feeds of mine. You should only be subscribed to one feed and
one feed only:

https://iambismark.net/index.xml

What happened is this:  

About two months ago, my .htaccess that should have redirected everything
from my old RSS feed to my new RSS feed stopped working.  I didn't realize
this until last night and now I have fixed it.  Some people are subscribed
to multiple feeds from me (http://cpanra.org/ryan/feed,
http://www.iambismark.net/feed, etc) all of which, as of last night,
correctly redirect to the feed posted above. Thus the repeats.
