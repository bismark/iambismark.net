Dear Anonymous,

Sorry for the long delay in responding.  I usually eat Brie cheese with
a smug sense of self-importance.

Mariam says it goes nicely with fruit.  We will have to take her word for
it.

As far as sleep goes, I suggest waiting until the evening. 10:22 AM tends
be a bit early for sleep, especially if you have only been awake since
8:00 AM.

Pro tip: better sleep patterns might make others more interested in
becoming committed to you.
