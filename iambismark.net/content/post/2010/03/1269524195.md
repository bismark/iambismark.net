> How does it feel to be a small-time celebrity?

--- Anonymous

Dear Anonymous,

I'm living the life, what can I say.

Actually, I am nowhere near the celebrity that I used to be.  During my
heyday at BYU, I had the entire female readership of the [100 Hour
Board][1] pining for my presence.  I was famously named the unofficial
minor heartthrob of the Board. Now I live a much more subdued lifestyle,
which is fine.  I'm no longer that wild young stallion of my youth.

Seriously though, much fewer people read my blog than before.  I think the
shift from Blogger -> Wordpress on cpanra.org -> Wordpress on
iambismark.net -> Tumblr left a few readers on the wayside.  But that's
ok. I am a much less prolific blogger than I used to be.  I think one of
the biggest reasons for that is my stabilized love life.  Angst over
failed love is a great motivator for creating interesting art.  Reading
about how happy someone is usually a lot less entertaining.  But
I wouldn't up Mariam in a million years just to be a more interesting
blogger.

These questions are fun to answer! Keep it up Anonymous readers!
