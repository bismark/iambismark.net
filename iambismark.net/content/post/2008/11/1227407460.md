title: fun afternoon, disappointing evening
---

i decided i wanted to start getting out and doing some more fun things
(which i have been severely lacking this semester), so i invited a bunch
of friends to go rock climbing at the climbing gym today. its been over
a year since i've been climbing, so i knew i was in for quite a shock.
i only went up four times, doing a 5.5, a 5.6, a 5.7, and then back down
to a 5.5. my forearms ache pretty bad, and im sure they will even more in
the morning. but it was a ton of fun nevertheless! here are pics!!

the survivors, quivering forearms and all.

after climbing we stopped by cafe rio, then mariam invited me over to her
place to watch the holy war. i think the title of this post is all i need
to say about that.

gosh my arms are sore.
