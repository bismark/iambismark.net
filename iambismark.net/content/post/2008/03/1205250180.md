title: those little frustrations

i am collecting "pepsistuff" points, since they can buy mp3s and CDs from
amazon.com. so its just kind of an added bonus to having a soda to sip on
during the day to keep me awake at work. well, i bought a diet pepsi today
from the vending machine instead of the cafeteria, and it ended up being
an older bottle without the pepsistuff code. grr.
