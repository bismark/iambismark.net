ok, so no, i didn't go to a dance. i went to a little shindig at an
acquaintances house. they had guitar hero 3. yeah.

afterwards a few of us hit up the international house of pancakes. i ate
when i shouldn't have.

i only got paid for 1 week since i had messed up my time card. that makes
the next two weeks a little tight on cash, but my next paycheck should be
sweet with 3 weeks of pay, plus my "relocation package" money (supposedly
to help offset the cost of me moving here... which of course i am getting
over a month after i already paid for moving here...), so that will be
nice.

my family is starting a new website. its unclear as to how open it is
going to be, so i don't know if i will be able to share any of it with
you. we already have a small photo gallery and the beginnings of a family
history wiki. its fun so far, and i think one of my weekend projects is
going to be designing an interface in iweb. right now all we have us is
a microsoft publisher template page. it looks like it was written for
netscape version 4... woo.
