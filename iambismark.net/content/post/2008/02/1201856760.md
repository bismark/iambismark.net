i think i have become obsessed with shaving. yes, weird, i know. but the
other day i was at the store just standing in front of the after-shave,
and i realized how ignorant i was about taking care of my own face.
i submitted a question to the 100 hour board about when i should wash my
face (before or after the shave), but today this was on digg:

[how to shave like your grandpa][1]

it opened a whole new world to me! now i definitely know what is on my
list once my next paycheck rolls around! i am planning on buying a safety
blade, a badger hair brush (maybe splurge on a silver tipped one??), some
real shaving soap, some pre-shave oil, everything! everyone i have told
thinks its totally weird, but i am really excited about it!

here are some other links about shaving:

- [mantic59's shaving video tutorials][2]
- [badger and blade shaving forums][3]
- [shavemyface.com][4]
- [shave blog][5]

no more scraping my face and slathering on the chemicals!
