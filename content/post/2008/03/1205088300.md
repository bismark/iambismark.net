is it wrong of me that i remove girls from my facebook friends once they
get married? i mean, its not like i am against married people or anything,
but it just feels weird having a married girl as a friend. there are a few
i am cool with keeping, since we were pretty good friends before and after
their marriage, but just for some of girls i was friends with only a short
while, as soon as i see that they are married, i usually just delete them.
i wonder if thats wrong of me. maybe i just don't feel like seeing my news
feed filled with wedding pictures? unless of course those pictures include
me crashing the wedding reception...
