i haven't written on net neutrality before, but i hope you all realize how
important it is. how would you like to have to pay to access "premium"
site such youtube or even google? how about having to pay for "premium"
services such as picture sharing, video downloads, or even blogging? the
telecommunication companies want to create a tiered network in order to
squeeze more money from us. the problem with that is they are trying to do
this over the network lines that have been subsidized by our tax money.
the internet is not theirs to regulate. net neutrality will ensure that we
are able to have equal access to all parts of the internet no matter who
we choose as our internet provider.

and guess which presidential candidate is strongly for net neutrality?
vote obama to keep enjoying your internet.
