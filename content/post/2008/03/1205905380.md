as some of you might have noticed from my [twitter status][1] last night,
i was doing some garbage digging in search of a receipt for a piece of
clothing i wanted to return (side note: i never did find the receipt, but
i returned it and they gave me a full refund anyway). i guess this garbage
digging must have rubbed off on me, because today as i was putting an
empty diet pepsi bottle into the recycling can, i noticed a couple of
other pepsi bottles with their caps still on in there, and the first thing
i thought was "ooh, [pepsi stuff points][2]." thankfully before i started
digging through the used plastic bottles i realized i was in a public
place surrounded by coworkers and i thought better of it. on 49 bottles
left until i have enough for a cd!
