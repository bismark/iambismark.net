there is a dance tomorrow night. do i go?

pros:

- possibility of meeting attractive women

cons:

- i am a bad dancer
- i am not good at meeting new people
- i am not good at asking girls to dance
- it takes me a while to warm up with the charm
- there is only a slight chance the girl would reciprocate the interest
  even if i make it past all of those issues

question: is the possibility of me meeting my jessica alba worth the pain
and humiliation? good question.
