well, it has only taken me 10 days, but i think i am pretty much unpacked.
my room is basically organized, and its pretty dang empty to be honest.
i really don't own that much stuff, and maybe about a third of it is
sitting in my friends' basement back in provo (thanks girls!). but i guess
its good to stay lean and mobile during this part of my life.

so as i was unpacking i started getting hit with some nostalgia. i was
trying to organize some of my office supplies, and i was realizing how
some of them were the same ones my mom helped me buy at walmart back in
wisconsin a few days before i left for byu. so, yes, i was having office
supply nostalgia.

man, these three years have gone by fast. i should be more grateful for
the time i have.
