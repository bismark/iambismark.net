long time, no post. i got paid on friday. it feels nice being rich. it
might be a bit tough going back to school in the fall.

i have exciting news. this is what i bought as part of my new shaving hobby:

- [DE Blade Sampler Pack, Standard][1]
- [Merkur "Hefty Classic" Safety Razor][2]
- [Vulfix #2233 Super Badger Shaving Brush][3]
- [ Shaving Brush Stand, Nickel ][4]
- [Taylor of Old Bond Street Luxury Shaving Cream][5]

- [Musgo Real Glycerin Lime Oil Soap][6]

and possibly most important:

- [Nick Relief Styptic Liquid][7]

all of these purchases were made after a number of hours of research, so
i think like i am getting some really good quality stuff. this might all
seem expensive (and yeah, it was), but this stuff is an investment. the
razor itself could become an heirloom they are so well made, and i got
a very good quality badger hair brush that should last me many years. in
the long run, the double-edge blades are much cheaper than mach3
cartridges, so after a few years it will pay for itself. this should be
good.

goda (lil' bro) flew into san fran yesterday so i went down there to spend
some time with the fam. my grandpa bought himself a wii for his birthday,
so we had some fun with that.

i think i am going to hold off on buying an iphone. yes yes, the apple
fanboi is still not fully sold on it. 3G is the deal breaker for me. so,
my plan is to buy my coworker's unlocked blackjack for $80, get an AT&T
contract, and then wait it out until the 3G iphone (which is hopefully by
next christmas).
