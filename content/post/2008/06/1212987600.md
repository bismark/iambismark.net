twelve hours until the biggest event in technology of the year. work is
going to be VERY tough to do tomorrow, with live blogs, post keynote
commentary, (hopefully) downloading of new firmware, searching through the
app store for new programs, solidifying sales plan of my current iphone,
and counting my pennies in anticipation for june 15th (i will eat my foot
if i am wrong on the date). now i remember how christmas felt as a little
child.
