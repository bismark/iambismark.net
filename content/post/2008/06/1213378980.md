thank you to the 5 members who made the right decision and put an end to
the executive branch's power grabs at unconstitutionally suspending habeas
corpus. it makes me feel much safer knowing that the executive branch is
still limited by checks and balances and the constitution. even if the
candidate i support for president wins this november, i would hate to see
the same excesses that have been displayed for the last 8 years by the
current administration. thank you for defending what i believe to be
a divinely inspired document.
