please do not vote for john mccain. his [willingness to continue][1] the
unconstitutional expansion of executive powers and infringement on
personal privacy and liberty are an insult to American values. the chances
of another "conservative" president making any changes to the [few
social/moral issues][2] you might be concerned with are quite low, while
the chances are quite high that he will continue the same terrible
policies of the last eight years which have brought this country into
economic depression, made us lose our moral authority in the world by
using torture and other un-American "anti-terrorism" tactics, and spent
billions of dollars and thousands of lives on a war that [we were lied
to][3] about.
