i always knew i could learn something by reading the daily unifarce. here
is a great quote i definitely plan on using in my moral government
sacrament meeting talk:

"Let us conquer ourselves, and then go to and conquer all the evil that we
see around us, as far as we possibly can. And we will do it without using
violence; we will do it without interfering with the agency of men or of
women. We will do it by persuasion, by long-suffering, by patience, and by
forgiveness and love unfeigned, by which we will win the hearts, the
affections and the souls of the children of men to the truth as God has
revealed it to us." -joseph f. smith, gospel doctrine 253-254
