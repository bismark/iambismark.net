from my missionary journal, dated friday, august 29th, 2003:

"Tonight Yoshiki, the Toyama elder's eternal investigator and the fluent
English speaker in our Eikaiwa [english conversation class], took us out
to a tabehoudai [all-you-can-eat restaurant]. We ate a lot and had some
good fun talks, mostly a debate as to whether I am going to BYU after my
mision ends and finding a wife very quickly or if I will stay outside of
Utah, but only time will tell!"

interesting what time has brought.
