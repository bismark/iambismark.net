title: fun afternoon, disappointing evening

i decided i wanted to start getting out and doing some more fun things
(which i have been severely lacking this semester), so i invited a bunch
of friends to go rock climbing at the climbing gym today. its been over
a year since i've been climbing, so i knew i was in for quite a shock.
i only went up four times, doing a 5.5, a 5.6, a 5.7, and then back down
to a 5.5. my forearms ache pretty bad, and im sure they will even more in
the morning. but it was a ton of fun nevertheless! here are pics!!

afte r climbing we stopped by cafe rio, then mariam invited me over to her
place to watch the holy war. i think the title of this post is all i need
to say about that.
