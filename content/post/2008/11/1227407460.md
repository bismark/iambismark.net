i decided i wanted to start getting out and doing some more fun things
(which i have been severely lacking this semester), so i invited a bunch
of friends to go rock climbing at the climbing gym today. its been over
a year since i've been climbing, so i knew i was in for quite a shock.
i only went up four times, doing a 5.5, a 5.6, a 5.7, and then back down
to a 5.5. my forearms ache pretty bad, and im sure they will even more in
the morning. but it was a ton of fun nevertheless! here are pics!!

[![rock climbing 25][1]][2] me super excited to kick some serious rock
booty!

slightly awkward harness.

[![rock climbing 22][5]][6] my friend bj having a dandy time.

[![rock climbing 21][7]][8] andrew, krista, and mariam definitely not
psyched up enough yet.

[![rock climbing 20][9]][10] me losing my concentration and acting like
a little japanese girl.

[![rock climbing 18][11]][12] my picture captioning skills fail me.

[![rock climbing 19][13]][14] to the left is will. he is much better than
all of us at climbing which makes everything very fun for him at all of
our expenses.

[![rock climbing 17][15]][16] jessica is loving belaying so much its like
a dream to her.

[![rock climbing 16][17]][18] this is kyle, blissfully unaware of his
dreaming partner below.

[![rock climbing 15][19]][20] here i am tackling this wall in a very manly
fashion.

[![rock climbing 14][21]][22] here is mariam enjoying a rest in a very
non-manly fashion.

[![rock climbing 13][23]][24] this picture gives me diabetes.

[![rock climbing 12][25]][26] the happy couple enjoying time together
while one of them holds a humans life in her hands.

[![rock climbing 11][27]][28] will mocking us all some more.

[![rock climbing 10][29]][30] one of the many natural rock formations we
used as grips.

[![rock climbing 9][31]][32] mariam laughing her way to the top.

[![rock climbing 8][33]][34] kyle and jessica wondering how they got these
strange ropes tied around themselves.

[![rock climbing 7][35]][36] me being so excited that krista made it to
the top that i forgot to hold on.

[![rock climbing 6][37]][38] krista holding on for dear life.

[![rock climbing 5][39]][40] i actually do know how to belay....

[![rock climbing 4][41]][42] mariam's grip of death. but it was ok since
we had more time to climb with one less person.

[![rock climbing 3][43]][44] me climbing the wall in an even manlier
fashion.

[![rock climbing 2][45]][46] a natural rock formation shaped like an
upside down Buddha's belly. i rubbed it for good luck.

[![rock climbing 1][47]][48] the survivors, quivering forearms and all.

afte r climbing we stopped by cafe rio, then mariam invited me over to her
place to watch the holy war. i think the title of this post is all i need
to say about that.

gosh my arms are sore.
