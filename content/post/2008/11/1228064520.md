my vacation is almost over. i didn't get nearly as much done as i wanted
to, but i certainly got in a lot of relaxing! friday i went out shopping.
i needed to really because i had run out of shampoo, but i figured i might
as well stop in to some stores to see if there was anything worthwhile on
sale. yeah, there really wasn't. mall clothes really bore me. i did pick
up two just basic sweater for cheap from the gap though just because
i figure i can always use basic sweaters.

oh, and for those who are not in the know, [operation levis][3] has been
aborted. the 501s just werent me i decided, though i tried for quite
a long time. so i did go in search of a new pair of jeans, but everyone
failed me again. i ended up snagging a pair of diesels for really cheap
online at this [site][4].

as far as shampoo, i've decided to give the american crew citrus mint line
a try. i've become a bit tired of the nancy boy scent, and i read some
good reviews on my shaving sites, so i picked some up while at the mall.
so far, i really like it.

friday night my friend jessica invited me to go see comedy sportz. its
been a few years since i've gone, so it was fun to go again. i laughed
a good bit, though as is usual with improv, some of it fell flat.
i remember the first time i went to the one in madison with my high school
girlfriend... ah memories. saturday i did get a bit of my homework done so
that was good. i then realized that the gift certificate to tucanos that
my [mom had sent me][9] expired at the end of the month, so i quickly
called up mariam to enjoy my birthday dinner with. it was her first time,
and we had fun. i think she out ate me to be honest... i just can't eat
like a 24 year old anymore. and of course she had to mention that we were
there for my birthday, so i got the whole song and dance.

this is me standing outside of tucanos next to one of the trees. i am
holding my birthday ice cream.

mariam most likely complaining about the lack of snow. after waddling back
to the car, we went to her house to watch 2001: a space odyssey. she had
never seen it and we decided to watch it since she claimed that she never
falls asleep during movies and i bet her i could find a movie that would
put her to sleep. surprisingly we both made it through the entire thing,
stomachs full of meat and all. i still had no idea what the end was
supposed to mean though....
