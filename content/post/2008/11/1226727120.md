i had a fun evening! i guess i can't say that i have done that on a friday
in a long long time. i'm glad i finally could again.

![divine comedy 6][1]

yes, it was all sold out!

little bro was kind enough to pick me up a ticket to divine comedy for
this evening. he got two for himself, but after not finding a date (hang
in there bro!) he gave me the extra. so i invited my friend kristy to come
down from salt lake city to enjoy it with us! i'm glad she did, cuz
i enjoyed hanging out with her again.

long lines...

kristy and adam!

adam being a goof

the show was pretty good. i miss some of the old days, and the remake of
the "every sunday school lesson ever given" skit was certainly not as good
as the original, but i still laughed it up. also, people just don't have
as much fun between skits. i always stood up, danced, and waved around my
glow sticks, but i was basically the only one to do it tonight. eh, it was
still awesome.

daily unifarce headlines!

my old roommate on stage for a skit

i found out my old roommate jeremy is now a member of the troupe. that
made me laugh and also remember some fun summer evenings of sitting up and
talking about just about anything until 2 in the morning. the best part
was his video montage with "don't stop believing" as the music. soundtrack
of summer '07. classic.

me living it up and freaking out kristy

after the show, we drove up to little bro's house to pick up my much
belated birthday gift (i FINALLY got the best of cat stevens cd! yay!).
sadly we all forgot about the basketball game ended, but that was ok
because kristy and i got to chat it up and sing along to cat stevens. it
was a happy evening for me.

i am going to seattle tomorrow. i am pretty nervous about the whole
interview thing. we shall see! amidst all of the crap lately, i totally
spaced the fact that my friend bridgette moved to seattle a little while
ago, so we are going to hang out! after my dinner on saturday night with
a byu alumnus, she said she could go out and see the city. partay time. it
will be nice to have a friend there to enjoy things with.

anyway, time to keep packing. i will do my best to take lots of pics and
write about how the whole adventure goes!
