Every afternoon  
I point a hammer home  
You had no follow through, follow through  
Better off alone  
  
Waiting patiently  
Stranded in your sea  
  
Singing time in tune  
Where the action is  
Need the stars and moon, stars and moon  
Wanted more than this  
  
Waiting patiently  
Stranded in your sea  
  
Cause I'm waiting for you  
And all you can do  
So little to prove  
Time is the test of trust  
The best of us  
For hours, for hours  
  
Every afternoon  
I point a hammer home  
I have no time for you, time for you  
Better off alone  
  
Waiting patiently  
Stranded in your sea  
  
Cause I'm waiting for you  
And all you can do  
So little to prove nobody knew  
Must have been you  
Didn't it prove  
But someday I'll be free  
You'll wait for me  
For hours, for ours
