ok, my blog has now officially moved to here:

[http://www.iambismark.net][1]

do the smart thing and update your bookmarks! plus, if you visit the old
site, it should redirect you to the new one after a few seconds. for you
feed users out there, i tried to get RSS feeds working correctly, but
i think i failed. please update your feeds to this:

[http://www.iambismark.net/feed][2]

its been a good run and i hope to see you all over at the new site!
