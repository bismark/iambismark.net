if you didn't know, i am not a huge fan of web apps. i suppose i am a bit
of a luddite, but desktop apps seem much more polished and robust. i hate
constantly keeping tabs open and i hate site loading times. so i use apple
mail instead of gmail, adium instead of gchat, ical instead of google
calendar, etc. and for a news reader, i use the totally amazing and free
[netnewswire][1].

its an all around great app. the only thing that i feel like i am missing
is google reader's article sharing. for those of you who arent familiar
with it, its a nifty feature that lets you share links back and forth with
your gchat contacts. on a number of occasions i've had an insensitive clod
ask me why i hadn't read the link they shared.

so, i've found a [solution][2]. now i have access to my google
reader-using friends' feeds.

for those of you who want to see my shared links, go ahead and subscribe
to the feed found [here][3].
