last night, i paid the $140 fee and selected a date to take the graduate
record examination (GRE). august 9th, 8:30 am. this is something i have
been avoiding for way too long, so its both exciting and scary to finally
get started down this path. i've got a few schools i am starting to
research. i am going to work towards getting my masters degree.
