found this looking around on my hd. i think it was the beginning of
a sonnet i was supposed to write for my freshman english class:

Vending Machine

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thy coolness keeps my food from spoil and rot
My throat is parched by the summer's ray,
It is quenched by the drink from you I bought.
In to your slot I place my hard earned wealth
A tasty burrito is what I select
