[![hiking][1]][2]

i was having kind of a rough day, so i went up the canyon this afternoon
for some alone time. i was wearing my church clothes but i walked a bit up
the trail (and got quite dusty), but it was really pretty and peaceful.
the pic is where i turned around. when i got back i read some scriptures
(mosiah and romans), and read a bit from one of my favorite books,
believing christ. i felt much better afterwards. i just did a lot of
thinking about my goals and whats important to me.
