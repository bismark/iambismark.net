ok, so back in high school i had a big crush on [rachel leigh cook][1]. my
friend and i went to see josie and the pussycats (still one of my all time
favorites), and i was just enamored. then i went out and rented she's all
that, and i fell even deeper for her. i downloaded desktop backgrounds and
i put up posters of her in my locker at school. anyway, i was friends with
the girl who's locker was next to mine, and so i would go over to her
house sometimes. her little brother and his friends had little rock band
called superheroes by night. for some reason they decided they wanted to
write a song about my crush for rlc. so, lo and behold, at their next
concert, they played the song. and it was on the lp they released. and
according to everyone it was the best song on the album. i was extremely
close to sending a copy of it to rachel just to see what she would say.
anyway, the post of this is not to re-announce my love for rlc (though
i still do have the josie and the pussycats movie poster up on my wall),
but to announce that in some random searching i found that the mp3 of the
song is available for free [here][2]. i just cracked up and wondered how
many people have tried downloading this song to hear about my high school
celebrity crush.
