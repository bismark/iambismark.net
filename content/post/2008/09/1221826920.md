ive been really exhausted lately from lack of sleep for some reason.
i guess i just need to get my body used to 6 hours of sleep again. anyway,
yesterday was pretty tough as far as being tired, but i still had a rough
time sleep last night. i had a very unpleasant sleep, and i woke up this
morning at around 5:30 covered in sweat and my pillow covered in saliva.
i was having a nightmare about operating systems and seriously the first
thought i had was "no! you need to have mutual exclusion!" (i think there
is maybe one or two of you reading this that will actually get that...)
lets just say it was of my less pleasant experiences.
