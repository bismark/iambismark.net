hi again everyone

yes, i am still here. i survived the long and lonely trip across nevada
and the salt flats. i've just been busy for the last with getting started
with the semester. i have a blog post in works talking about my last few
weeks in sacramento, so hopefully i will get that up soon.

right now i am in the library in my favorite study area (5th floor
cubicles on the west side), listening to the byu game and starting on some
studying. i plan on going lifting with goda later on and after that
watching a japanese film at the international cinema.

just keeping ya'll up to date.
