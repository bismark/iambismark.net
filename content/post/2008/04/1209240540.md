this is pretty funny, since its happened on multiples occasions with
different girls in the last year. just over the course of a conversation,
the topic of beds has come up for some reason. the girl starts claiming
how much she loves her bed, how comfortable it is, etc. and i say
something like, "oh, really?" and then she responds something like "yeah,
you should totally try it out." now these have been good active LDS girls,
so not really expecting them to say something like that, so i just give
them this look, kind of an amused smirk (think jim halpert). they realize
what they just said and quickly make an awkward change of subject.
i giggle inside so as not to embarrass them.

so much for making a good blog post after a drought.
