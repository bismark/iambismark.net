bowling in small town wisconsin is like eating the ash out of an ashtray
after rubbing it all over your clothes. fun.

we played imaginiff at our pre-new years party. apparently my friends
think that if i a was a tv channel, it would be MTV (huh??), if i was
a movie it would be 2001: A Space Odyssey, and if i was a villain, it
would be Lex Luther.

i just got home (12:30 AM) and my mother is watching tv for some reason.
not the most common sight.

i have never grown my facial hair as long as it was, so i wasn't really
sure how to shave it off correctly. well, obviously hacking away at it
with a straight razor was the wrong idea, because man did that hurt. my
face still feels scraped.
