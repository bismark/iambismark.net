so, i was in line to buy some chicken broccoli pasta (one of the few
things i will still eat in the cougar eat) and there was this really hot
asian/polynesian (the good polynesian.. not the kind that will eat you for
breakfast) girl next to me. well, as i was getting my drink, she kept
checking me out. after the first look, i didn't think anything about it,
but after she turned her head and looked at me the third time, i was
pretty sure what was going on. i think it must be my new hair cut. anyway,
so i was trying to play it cool, but some how lost track of filling up my
cup and i ended up overfilling it and getting fresca everywhere. the end.
