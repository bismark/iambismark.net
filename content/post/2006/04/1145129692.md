yeah, we had to translate a japanese song called _ue wo muite_ into
english for one of my classes.. here is what i wrote:

## I Look Above Me ##

Translated by Ryan Johnson

I look above me,  
so no one else can see,  
The tears that fall as I walk down this street,  
I think of the day,  
you left me in spring,  
Another night of solitude

I look above me,  
its hard for me to see,  
The stars in the sky through these tear filled eyes,  
I remember when you,  
left me in summer,  
Another night of solitude

Maybe there will be happiness up there,  
Somewhere in the clouds and the sky above

I look above me,  
so no one else can see,  
The tears that fall as I walk down this street,  
The tears wont stop,  
because I know,  
Another night of solitude

(Whistling)

I know this fall,  
you will just leave,  
Another night of solitude

This sadness comes down to me from above,  
Its in my shadow cast by the moon

I look above me,  
so no one else can see,  
The tears that fall as I walk down this street,  
The tears wont stop,  
because I know,  
Another night of solitude

Another night of solitude

(Whistling)

haha!
