my feelings:

at first, i was a bit surprised. i mean, that is a ton of information that
they are throwing out there for us to see. i was worried about stalkers,
losing privacy, etc etc, just as everyone was i am sure.

but then i got to thinking about it. everything we do on facebook is
public to our friends anyway. if you have someone one your friends list
you don't want to be seeing what you have done, well then why are they on
your friend's list? if someone is stalking you, they will have already
been watching everything listed on the news feed.

once again, here in the information age, we have a conflict of
accesibility vs privacy. we have the exact same problem with google. we
need to realize that things we publish on the world wide web are not
private. the purpose of facebook is to share personal information with our
friends. if you dont want people to see it, dont put it up. the news feed
adds a great deal of simplicity to keeping up to date with your friends.
maybe now people will learn that adding every random personal possible
defeats the purpose of facebook. only keep your real friends on here, and
use it to stay up to date and to improve your off-the-net social life.
