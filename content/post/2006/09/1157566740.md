i think facebook does need to do a bit of tweaking with this new system
though. we should have power over what gets broadcast, to whom it gets
broadcast to, etc. it was quite a drastic move on their part, and without
any field testing, i think it was a bit silly of them also. there are good
things to the system, but it needs work.
