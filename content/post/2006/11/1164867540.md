yes, i am growing one. i figure it will be a deterrent to all of those
foaming at the mouth women who want to kiss me... right.

but actually, while i was walking around today, my upper lip did feel
noticeably warmer than the rest of my face.

so far i have been called a child molester and a sexy Unabomber while
standing in a crowded airport (ok, i added the sexy part... but its true).

i think it will make me look older, which i suppose could be a good or bad
thing. i will probably be more intimidating. guys with facial hair always
are. girls with facial hair are too to be honest.

so, yes, if you see a tall redheaded guy with a kick-a mustache, its
probably me, so give a holla.
