So, yes, I will admit that the last Harry Potter film actually
[inspired][1] me something good in me: reading more books. Prior to last
summer, I had probably read less than 10 books recreationally since
graduating from high school. Pretty sad for someone who likes to pretend
he is a geek.

But things are much better now. Since seeing the Harry Potter movie, here
is what I have read:

* The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, Mockingjay)
* A Song of Ice and Fire (A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of
  Swords, A Feast for Crows, A Dance with Dragons)
* The City and The City
* Ready Player One
* Ender's Game
* The Watchmen
* (Currently reading) Snow Crash

I'm pretty happy about going from reading 0 books to now 12 in a year.
Maybe I will write some mini-reviews for the above over the next few days.

On a side not, I signed up for a GoodReads account thinking it would be
a good way to track books that I've read, but I dunno if I will be able to
use it... I found it much too fiddly. I felt like I could spend all day on
there rating and tagging and it bothered me that I couldn't remember the
exact date that I finished certain books. I think a simple list with
month/year would be plenty.
