Whoa, long time no blog.  Time to catch up a bit.

Two weeks ago I took off a Friday from work for a whirlwind trip down to
Disneyland.  It was Mariam's first time, so it was fun introducing her to
it all.  We went with my grandparents and my Aunt Wendi, who is pretty
much as hardcore as you can get concerning Disneyland, which was nice.
Since she knows all the ways to work the park, we never had to stand in
line (those Fast Passes are a pretty good idea) and we always had a great
view for the shows.  We left the Bay area at around 4 am on Friday and
didn't get back until around 8 pm Sunday night, and it was non-stop the
whole time we were there, so by the end, we were both crazy tired.  A lot
of fun though.  Some of the highlights include: 

* Mariam completely hiding herself for the entire Splash Mountain ride
  because of her fear of the big drop.
* Mariam almost crying because we got stuck in the far back seat on the
  big roller coaster in California Adventure and then having her say she
  loved it after we got off.
* Mariam and I getting the back row on a late Pirates of the Caribbean
  ride and.. oh never mind.


Here are a few pics:

Before going in we stopped by to say Hi to Grandma Tic Tock's brick.  She
was my great-grandma who passed away two years ago.  It's nice to have
that there just a few feet away from the entrance.

Here is the requisite shot in front of Sleeping Beauty's castle.  Quite
a beauty if you ask me.

I let Mariam drive on all the rides, including Autopia.  This about sums
up how I felt the whole time.  Wild ride indeed.

As you can see, Mariam got a first timer badge and we both got "Just
Married" badges as well.  I guess "just" was used rather loosely; it was
always a bit awkward when people asked us when we got married and we would
say April. Just having that many people coming up to ask was awkward
enough already.

And yes, in case you didn't notice in the last picture, this is Mariam
ruthlessly destroying the dreams of small children around the world.

This is me eating a huge piece of turkey.

Saturday night Mariam and I got some time to ourselves so of course we
went to Fantasyland to ride on the little kid rides.  We did the tea cups
right after I ate a corn dog.  Bad idea.

Our last ride was the carousel.  That was nice.

Off into the sunset...
