I took off a few weeks from Sunday cooking due to July 4th and the
Disneyland trip, but I was able to start up again last week.  I got really
excited when I first saw [this recipe][1] for Slavonian burgers and I'm
glad I made them: they were great.  Mariam had me make them again later in
the week with some of the leftover ingredients because she liked them so
much.

[![The ingredients][2]][3]

Here is the set of ingredients, nothing too fancy, which is good for
a mageirocophobic person like me.

[![Chopping][4]][5]

If my hand are chopping, then who is holding the camera??? On a related
note, apparently I can chop garlic.

[![Ball-o-meat][6]][7]

Here is the ball-o-meat I created after mixing together the beef, the
garlic, and the spices.  The first time I made the burgers, I was too
timid with the paprika and the cayenne pepper.  The second time around
things were quite a bit warmer.

[![Frying][8]][9]

Frying away.

[![Steaming hot buns][10]][11]

The buns were definitely the most difficult part of the recipe, and to be
honest I am still not sure I got them right.  They got pretty soggy after
a bit of steaming and the dipping into the broth.  They kind of stuck to
the pan when I tried to fry them.  They ended up being kind of hot and
gooey, which perhaps is right? I may never know given the dearth of
Slavonians in my life. And no, these are not ciabatta rolls; our local
Safeway seemed to not sell anything of that sort.

[![The final product][12]][13]

Here is the final product, fresh green onion and all.  That chip in the
plate takes away a bit from the artistic value doesn't it...  The green
onion dipped in salt was pretty tasty I might add.

And another happy customer, which is definitely my best motivation for
doing this stuff.
