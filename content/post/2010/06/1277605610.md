title: Follow up on "Do You See What I See?"
---

The teacher from the [project I donated to earlier this year][1] has
posted some pictures and a follow-up note: 

> ...Hands on material is such a wonderful way to extend a lesson. Thank
> you again for helping to make Science an exciting topic for my students.
> Your gifts will be well used in my classroom for years to come...

I dunno what if any impact having some fun science experiments will have
for these kids, but if any of them decides that continuing to learn and
work hard at school is just a little more worthwhile than they thought
before, that will be some of the best $25 I've ever spent.
