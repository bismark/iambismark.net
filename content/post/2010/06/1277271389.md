title: Tomato-Butter Sauce
---

To kick off my attempts at becoming a better cook, I decided to stick with
something simple: a four ingredient [tomato-butter sauce][1]. Amazingly,
I actually pulled it off at it tasted great.  Here are a few pics:

![Me and a can of tomatoes][2]

Yes, silly me, I used can tomatoes. We even had a bag of fresh, bright red
tomatoes in our fridge; I was just too much of a wimp to try peeling them
myself.  One step at a time I suppose.

![Red blogs of goodness][3]

Squishy balls of red goop.

![Time to get squishing][4]

Like I said, squishy.  Crushing them was just as fun as Neven claimed.

![Not exactly healthy][5]

Yeah, this wasn't exactly "healthy", but hey, everyone needs to live
a little.

![Tomatoes, butter, onion, salt][6]

So here are all the ingredients (tomato, butter, onion, salt) together in
the pot.  I was actually surprised how little salt I needed to add, though
I am sure the fact that the butter was salted made a big difference.

This is the sauce reduced after about 40 minutes of simmering and
occasional stirring.  It was amazing how flavorful it became without any
extra ingredients.  We took the onion out and I actually ate half of it as
part of dinner. It was really tender and sweet.

And here is the final product.  Both Mariam and I really liked how it
turned out and I plan on making this sauce again in the future (next time
with fresh tomatoes and maybe a few herbs for variety).  Yum!
