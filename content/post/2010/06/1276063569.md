Like I said in my [previous post][1], I've started getting interested in
creating pixel art.  Per Neven Mrgan's [advice][2], I decided a good start
would be to imitate existing pixel art.  So here is my first attempt at
it: this is an imitation of Lucas from the game Mother 3 in this
[scene][3]. The one on the left is the actual size, the one on the right
in 5x.

I really don't like how it turned out at all.
