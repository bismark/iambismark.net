![replies][1]

[To organize all of the new Reply, Ask, and Submit... | Tumblr Staff][2]

So, Tumblr now allows replies for on posts via the Dashboard.  I have yet
to see an example of what a reply looks like, but I assume it looks
similar to a comment at the bottom of a post?

I've enabled it, but here is the catch: you have to have a Tumblr account
and you have to have been following me for two weeks (I only have one
follower currently... Hi [June][3]!).  So, do I turn off my fugly and slow
Instant Debate comments and say to my dear friends "Stop using Blogger and
get a real blogging platform if you want to reply" (probably something no
one will do)?

I still am not quite entirely sold on blog comments either....
