![new theme][1]

Ok, since no one liked my old school theme idea, I am trying something
else.  It's a jelly donut!  This is my first attempt at pixel art, and the
lighting is completely wrong in the bite of the donut and the jelly looks
stupid.  But I think I did a good job with the frosting and sprinkles.
Feedback and criticism is welcome.  It is a work in progress.
