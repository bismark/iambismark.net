Here is a question for my LDS readers:

Does anyone else feel like there is false doctrine in the second verse of
"Choose the Right" (#239):

> "There's the right and the wrong to every question;"

Every time I sing it I am like, wait, really?

Also, what is otherwise a very beautiful hymn, the second verse of "Lead,
Kindly Light" (#97) sometimes rubs me the wrong way...
