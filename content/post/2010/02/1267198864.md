[Aava Mobile's Intel Moorestown prototype hands-on][1]

This has been sitting in my drafts for a bit, so I better post it...

I remember when these guys came to Intel to talk about this device.  One
of the engineers on our team was giving a presentation on the Moblin
stack, so intern #2 and I decided to go listen in.  We snuck into the back
of the conference room, but someone saw us and decided we should introduce
ourselves to the Aava mobile team.

Well, intern #2 has some of the best salesman skills I have ever seen, so
he starts talking up some project that he did that has some direct
correlation to the Aava mobile guys and thus justifies his existence in
the meeting.

Next they turn to me and I am like a deer in headlights.  I mumble
something about doing a variety of projects and the Aava mobile people
just stared at me... thankfully one of the other engineers piped in with
some of the projects I had done that made me relevant.  Really I had done
quite a bit, I was just a bit caught off guard.

Of course everyone on my team made fun of me the rest of my internship for
letting intern #2 make me look like an idiot.
