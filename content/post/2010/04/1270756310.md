Like I [mentioned before][1], at Christmas I donated to a Donor's Choose
project called "Do You See What I See?".

The request is from a first grade teacher in a high poverty school in
Wisconsin seeking funds to purchase science equipment like microscopes and
fossil models.  I'm sure a few of my readers love science and discovery as
much as I do, so I'm sure you also fondly remember science class in
elementary school.  I can't imagine what it would be like as a child to
not have the opportunities to explore and learn just because my school
district was too poor to buy equipment.

The request expires in nine days and it is still severely lacking in
funding.  If you have a little bit of extra set aside for charity, please
consider donating to this project.  Thanks!
