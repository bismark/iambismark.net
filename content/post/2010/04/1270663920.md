[Enter To Learn...And Then Shut Up][1]

Oh BYU... I see nothing has changed since I left.  I took part in that
2006 protest; I still have the piece of duct tape that I put over my
mouth.

I was going to write a longer post about Mormon culture's fear of
controversy and debate, but I don't have the time now.  Someday maybe.
