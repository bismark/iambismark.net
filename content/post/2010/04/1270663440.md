![engagement photo][1]

[Kristy][2] and her sister Jenny took our engagement pictures last
Saturday.  Actually we were first going to take them on Thursday morning,
but the weather report looked menacing, so we moved it up to Tuesday
evening.  Of course a huge wind and dust storm decided blow in.

So we were left with early Saturday morning before General Conference.
And of course, it was pouring rain in Provo, which prompted this
[tweet][3]:

> screw you Utah.

Thankfully by the time we made it to Salt Lake City, it had stopped
raining.  That didn't stop it from being freezing cold.

However, even with the crappy circumstances, the pictures turned out
pretty decently.  I look like a total goof in 99% of them, but Mariam
looks great.  The above pic is probably my favorite.

Kristy blogged some of the best pics [here][4] and the full set is
[here][5].
