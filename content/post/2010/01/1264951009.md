The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury;
and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have
been committed...

&mdash; US Constitution, Article 3, Section 2.

Why is there any question about whether or not the 9/11 highjackers should
be tried in New York? I hate this terrorist boogeyman we have created. It
(not actual terrorists or actual actions) is one of the greatest threats
to our freedom today.
