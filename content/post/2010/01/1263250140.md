I have this weird habit of highlighting the paragraph of text that I am
reading on screen.  I have no idea why I started doing it; I guess it
helps me keep track of where I am reading on the screen.

Anyway, one thing that I really **hate** about [nytimes.com][1] is the
stupid little question mark bubble that pops up when I highlight a word.
When I try to highlight a paragraph by double-clicking on it, instead my
first click highlights the word and my second clicks the bubble, which
pops open some completely worthless page with a word definition or
something.  Makes reading on the site absolutely terrible.

Sometimes, these fancywancy "Web 2.0" value-added things are just total
crap.
