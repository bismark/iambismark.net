Ok, this might seem like a strange topic after such a long recess from
posting and given all of the really interesting things I *could* be
talking about (dropping out of school, new job, new apartment, etc). But
during the course of our unpacking, organizing, and trying to fit our
lives into a small San Francisco studio apartment, some stuff just had to
go. Being the unsentimental minimalist Scandinavian that I am, I was
pretty quick to toss things into the throw away/donation piles, some of
which Mariam had to fish out later.

Anyway, as a married man with Ikea furniture and a 401k, I decided that
the posters that adorned my walls through college were no longer needed.
Mariam convinced me to at least document them before I threw them all
away. So, here are the few posters that have stuck with me through the
years:

### Wall Drug

Ok, I really have no idea why I still have this thing.  I picked this up
about ten years ago on a family road trip back from my sister's college
graduation.  If you have never been to Wall Drug, well, don't worry about
it, you aren't missing much.  Honestly nothing sticks out from our short
stop there except for me wanting to make sure I got a bumper sticker.
Pretty weird thing to have kept on my wall this whole time.

### Boondock Saints

I picked up this poster at a BYU Bookstore poster sale a few years ago.
I found that a bit ironic... Such a goofy movie, perfect for a bunch of
roommates to sit around and watch late on a weekday night when we were
supposed to be studying. "There was a firefight!"

### Serenity

Good movie inspired by an amazing television show.  I remember reading
about Firefly on Slashdot and then being introduced to it by Kenji back in
Carriage Cove.  One of the few tv shows I have watched through multiple
times.  I think Kenji gave me this poster. "If wishes were horses..."

### Weezer Green Album

This one goes back a long ways.  My friend (girlfriend? who knows, life
was so complicated as a teenager :P) Lindsey gave this to me back in high
school. I *loved* Weezer.  I felt like Pinkerton was speaking directly to
my soul.  I spent many hours driving around playing and singing along to
Weezer during high school.  I haven't really kept up with their music,
though from what I hear, sadly I am not missing much. "The world has
turned and left me here.."

### Josie and the Pussycats

Ah, yes.  This poster (including the RLC's head cut out from some teen
girl magazine) held a special place in my high school locker.  I've
written about my huge crush on Rachael Leigh Cook [before][11], and this
poster was just a small part of that.  I remember watching [this][12]
music video over and over.  Oh man, early '00s pop punk.  And then there
was this [one][13]. She's All That? Still a good movie is you ask me.
Josie and the Pussycats? Ok, yeah, it was pretty terrible, and I am
ashamed to admit just how many time my friend Andrew and I watched it.
Man, it's making me all nostalgic :P. "It took six whole hours, and five
long days, for all your lies to come undone. And those three small words
were way too late, 'cause you can't see that I'm the one."

Anyway, those are the posters that survived high school and college. They
served me well.
