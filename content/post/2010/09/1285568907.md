Ok, since the last month has been absolutely insane with finding a new
apartment, moving all our stuff from Wisconsin, big releases at work, etc,
I decided to just make up for my lack of posting with some pictures and
short descriptions.

Here is Mariam and my grandparents with all of the furniture we bought at
Ikea.  Yeah, we basically furnished the whole place in one trip.  I am
still amazed that we were able to fit it all into the back of my grandpa's
SUV.  It was so stuffed that I had curl up in the back seat *and* have
Mariam sit on my lap.  Longest trip across the Bay ever.

So yeah, our apartment is very little.  It's half the size but twice the
price of where we were going to live in Madison.  The joys of San
Francisco.  We just used UPS to ship all of our stuff out (which
thankfully is not much, since we have *no* space left).  It took us about
a month to final get everything completely unpacked and all the furniture
built, but now it is really starting to feel like home.

As you can guess, this was quite the challenge.

My coworkers.  Yeah, this is what I have to put up with everyday at work.
We have fun.  Our schedule has been crazy busy, and I hope someday I will
be able to talk a little more about what I have been working on.  The
really fun thing is that the week of our move was when we were doing our
first major roll out.  Staying at work until 3 am and then spending the
next day moving suitcases is always a blast.

The weather in San Francisco has been really great for the past couple of
weeks.  We are finally getting our summer.  Mariam and I spent yesterday
out and about: first we went to the farmer's market to pick up supplies
for tonight's tacos dorados extravaganza at our grandparents house.  Then
we hit up Katanaya with Brooke and her boyfriend Jon, which was tasty.
Later in the afternoon Mariam and I walked up and down Crissy Field to
enjoy the awesome weather and that's when I took this picture.  Hard to
believe this is the same city where I spent the entire month of July
wearing a hoodie.

I think Mariam and I have finally entered a state of normalcy, something
that has been hard to come by since our wedding.  It's pretty crazy it's
already been 5 months.  Since it's her birthday and our six month
anniversary coming up in October, we are looking into doing something fun
like a long weekend up in Mendocino.  We shall see.  It's just nice to
finally feel like we can settle down.
