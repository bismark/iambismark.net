Ok, this is actually my second question (I am still working on the
response to the first one).

Am I still getting married? Yes. Do I want to be one of those annoying
people who always posts sappy blog posts about being so in love, etc? No.

Actually, part of the problem is that Mariam and I are in different
states... That means we really don't get to do a lot of fun stuff together
that maybe some other engaged people do.  Kind of sucks, but we are
looking forward to having adventures together after April.

Anyway, yes, the official date is April 24th.  I have website that I am
still working on (which some of you have seen) with more info and
pictures.  I am going out to Utah for spring break so that my friend
[Kristy][1] can take some engagement pictures for us.  Kind of cutting it
close I suppose, but you do what you have to do.

Honestly I have been so busy lately with school, job searches, and wedding
stuff that I haven't had any time to write real blog posts about all of
the crazy stuff going down.

And my fianc√©e is awesome and beautiful and I can't wait to be with her
all the time.
