[Meridian Magazine: In Chile: The Lord's Earthquake Warning][1]

This article has been passed around quite a bit this last week on the
Mormon blogosphere.  Just wanted to point out my little brother Adam in
the picture above.

A short personal account of the mission's preparations from a letter Adam
wrote on February 15th:

> I don't remember if I mentioned last change that we all got water
> filtration bottles. Well this change we got instruction sheets for what
> to do before, during and after an earthquake, and evacuation plans.
> Something big could happen soon in Chile!
