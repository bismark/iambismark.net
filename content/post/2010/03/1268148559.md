Well, I have heard that publicly sharing a goal is one of the best ways to
find motivation for it, so here we go:  I am going to start using my
Japanese again.  @molecularbond sent me a link about [cat cafes][1] in
Nagoya, and even though I think the only real purpose cats have in this
world is to provide us with funny pictures, it still made me 懐かしい for
all things Nihon.

My Japanese pretty much sucks now.  I used to be able to read newspaper
articles and carry on conversations about philosophical beliefs for hours.
Now I can barely remember how to correctly use certain grammar particles.
Sigh.

So, time to re-rip my J-Pop albums, finally get around to watching Ponyo,
and pull out my flashcards.  I am working on my Spanish currently, and
I think getting my brain back into multilingual mode will actually help
with that.

I would actually love a job where I could both program *and* use Japanese.
I should start looking for something like that.
