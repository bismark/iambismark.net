I went to the Madison Curling Club's Open House today with my roommate
Aaron and some of his friends.  This is him and I showing off our made
brushing skills.

Basically we got to pay just a few dollars to have club members teach us
the technique of the game.  It was a lot of fun and not nearly as easy as
I thought it would be.  Click through to see the [full set][2].
