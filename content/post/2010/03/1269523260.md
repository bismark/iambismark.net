> Is your pseudonym a misspelling of Bismarck?

&mdash; Anonymous

Dear Anonymous,

So, history of the name Bismark:

When I was about 12, my friends and I were pretty nerdy (I bet you
couldn't have guessed!) and we decided to form a little club called *The
Agency*.  It had something to do with our interest in government
conspiracies related to alien coverups.  We decided each of us needed code
names, and on the day we were deciding this, we happened to be eating
jelly-filled donuts.  In Canada and the midwest, jelly-filled donuts are
often called [bismarcks][1], sometimes [without the 'c'][2].  I said
I really loved the donuts, and the packaging used the "bismark" spelling,
so my agent name became "Agent Bismark."  My first email address was
bismark90 at hotmail, and the 'nym has stuck ever since.

One of these days I will have to dig up some of the old stuff from The
Agency and blog about it.  We  had an awesome webpage running on
Angelfire.com for a few years.
