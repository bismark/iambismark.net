My 501s from the original [Operation Levi's][1] are being laid to rest.
They got a *lot* of wear, and now the seat is so threadbare that holes are
beginning to appear.  Time to send them to Goodwill so someone can make..
I dunno, a quilt out of them.

The [shrink-to-fit 501s][2] didn't turn out as great as I had hoped, but
they are decent.  I think my next pair will probably just be some 514s.
