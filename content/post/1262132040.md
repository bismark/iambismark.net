Things I will miss about Mexico:

- unlimited access to quality Mexican food 
- spending everday with my amazing girlfriend getting to know more about
  her family and culture 

Things I won't miss about Mexico:

- Mexican buses/taxis on Mexican roads 
- not being able to flush toilet paper down the toilet and learning what
  the wastebasket next to the toilet is for
- a national scarcity of earplugs
