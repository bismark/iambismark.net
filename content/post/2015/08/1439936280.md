Sometimes I tweet things that I think are Pure Goldâ„¢ and they just get
ignored. So perhaps I should explain them more.

> In The Loop 2: Rogue Nation

&mdash; [July 31, 2015][1]

Ok, so I posted this right after seeing the latest Mission Impossible. If
you have not seen it, the tweet will make no sense.

If you have not seen the movie In The Loop, the tweet will still make no
sense. (I do recommend the movie, though only if you can handle an extra
large dose of profanity).

In The Loop follows Simon Foster, a bumbling British MP, played by Tom
Hollander, who also plays the Prime Minister of the UK in Mission
Impossible. When I saw him on screen, I chuckled to myself imagining Simon
Foster, post In The Loop, making his way to the top of the British
government inevitably to to be tranquilized by Tom Cruise.

And now that I've explained the joke, it is not funny at all.
