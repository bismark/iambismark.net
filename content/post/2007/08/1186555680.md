escape motorsports of provo ut (come on google pagerank!), the most inept
and worthless repair shop ever known to man, has finally finished my
scooter. of course they didn't call me to let me know this, i had to call
them. i went over there to pick it up, and the dude drove it out to the
parking lot for me and handed it over. i got on and started driving, but
instantly it felt a little off. i gave it a run around the block and
almost died by the end since it was wobbling all over the place. they gave
it to me with a flat front tire. hurray for them. they didn't charge me to
fill it up, which was lucky for them because my patience was done.

felt great to ride again.
