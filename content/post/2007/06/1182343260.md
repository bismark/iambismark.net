yummy food i ate in hokkaido:

- salmon
- crab
- salmon roe
- hokkaido melon
- melon flavored pocky
- melon flavored hai-chew
- melon flavored ice cream
- milk flavored ice cream
- miso ramen

it was a good trip. beautiful scenery. i am going to be completely honest
and say it was the first time i was actually proud to be a wisconsinite.
it actually made me feel nostalgic for the midwest, for green rolling
hills, for forests, for fields as far as the eye can see, and for cow
smell.
