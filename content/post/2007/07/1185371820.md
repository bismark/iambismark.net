currently locked in the staff staircase of the museum of art. i got to
work a little early today because it was raining and i got a ride. i took
the back staircase as usual to get downstairs to our clubhouse. well, the
doors are locked to get back out. all of them. no one has seen me through
the small windows yet either.

i am sure soon enough some custodian will come around and unlock me, but
for now, i thought i would just blog about it.
