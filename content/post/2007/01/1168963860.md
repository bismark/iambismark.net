we had an international potluck for our ward fhe last night. having lived
as a missionary in japan, i knew that making curry was the only way to go.
so, my roommate and i set out on the arduous task of making a big pot full
of curry and also a bunch of rice. we were a bit late, and as i carried
our pot up to the food table, i noticed someone had made "potato and
carrot curry" from sri lanka, which look suspiciously like my japanese
curry. they also had a bowl of rice, which looked like it actually tasted
good, unlike mine. well, that was rather embarrassing, because i am
a horrible cook, so i assumed the entire ward would find this out after
comparing the two curries. actually, things turned out not so bad. it
would seem that sri lankan curry has quite a different taste than japanese
curry (and i preferred the latter). but, the point of this whole story is
that i went to play practice stinking of curry and onions. opening night
is february 2nd, so mark your (you know who you are...) calendars.
