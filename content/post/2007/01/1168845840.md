- going to a dance, knowing beforehand that everyone was going to be way
  too young  

- being upset at the fact that everyone at the dance was way too young  

- acting stupidly because of being upset and doing things one will regret
  later  

- after acting stupidly, staying up until 3 AM watching movies
