another revolution around the sun.. hurray! well, hopefully it will be
a bit better than the last.

my list of resolutions:

- be a nice guy again. no more "slutting around" (thanks michelle!!).
- straight A's. no more of this A- crap.
- bring sexy back.
- less procrastinating.
- find a hobby.
- fall in love.
- have someone to kiss next news year eve.

just some thoughts.

didn't do a whole lot tonight. played games with the family, shot off the
little confetti cracker things, freaking the heck out of babe the dog.
drank my last glass of egg nog for this holiday season.

tomorrow: football games, cheese, and crackers.

did you know jimmy carter once was attacked by a swamp rabbit?

if wishes were horses, we'd all be eating steak.

its 4 am. another dreary night, though thankfully not cold enough to
freeze. my parents were kind enough to leave some lights on downstairs for
me. i decided i ought to go out and at least wish a few people a happy new
year. it ended up just being luke and i beating resistance: fall of man
and listening to emo music.

We twa hae run about the braes,  
and pu'd the gowans fine ;  
But we've wander'd mony a weary foot,  
sin auld lang syne.
