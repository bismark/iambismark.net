i took part in the peace rally yesterday. it went pretty well. we had
a good number of people honking their horns in support of peace, and
amazingly some people who were against our message. one line i heard
a couple of times was "support the first presidency!" i said to the guy
next to me that the first presidency acts as authorized representatives of
Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace, so it would sure
seem like taking part in a BYU sanctioned rally promoting world wide peace
is definitely in support of the first presidency's mission.

my favorite event of the day: two girls were stopped at the traffic light,
and they were obviously antagonistic to our message. the first one yelled
"my brother is in the army" and "you are not americans!" but the other
girl's proclamation was the best. i am pretty sure she was talking about
the vice president, but i will let the reader decide. she yelled, "i love
dick!"
