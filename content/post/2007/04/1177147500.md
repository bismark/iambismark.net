a quote from my paper:

"Since the article's topic is that of an asexual electrical circuit, the
authors avoid any sexist language by merely refraining from personifying
their design. Additionally, this lack of personification assists in giving
the paper a more professional tone."

seriously, has there ever been a greater exercise in futility?
