made it through the first weekend of hello dolly without too many major
hiccups. the polka still sucked. it didn't help that one of the girl's
wigs fell off onto the stage, which made ermengarde and i laugh and get
off step... the waltz was decent though. we made it around the stage
without tripping.

moving on...

something is missing... why am i always such a jackass that hurts people's
feelings? i am not a nice guy. as elder keen so aptly put, i am an
arrogant jerk.

i can see now why it is so much easier not to care.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night,  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly,  
All your life,  
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.  

i keep my principles and get burned. i lose my principles and get burned
harder.
