i realize this is totally just a product of the byu environment, but
i feel old. i don't know why. i am not old. i act even less old than i am.
i'm probably getting pretty close to high school senior maturity level
here. for example, today, latenighthunter and i tried really hard to use
as many "that's what she said" lines... i lost miserably. latenighthungter
was on a fricken roll. i still enjoy making crude comments from the car to
couples walking down the street at night... i play the air guitar... i am
still nervous around girls...

i definitely am not in as good of shape as i used to be... i ran a 6:45ish
mile today on the track just to see what it was like, and it was
definitely not as easy as it should have been. sad.
