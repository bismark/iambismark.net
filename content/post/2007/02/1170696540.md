i am in love with peanut butter moo'ds from jamba juice. yum. i try to
justify getting them often because it is from jamba juice so it must be
healthy, but to be honest, it is really just a peanut butter chocolate
banana milkshake made with frozen yogurt and soy milk. i just finished
a classic sized one here at work for breakfast. i got the energy boost
because i am freaking tired, but i am wondering how much that really
helped, cuz i still feel freaking tired.
