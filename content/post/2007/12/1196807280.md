see if you can guess.

"We've been on the run  
Driving in the sun  
Looking out for #1

California here we come  
Right back where we started from

Hustlers grab your guns  
Your shadow weighs a ton  
Driving down the 101

California here we come  
Right back where we started from

California!  
Here we come!

On the stereo  
Listen as we go  
Nothing's gonna stop me now

California here we come  
Right back where we started from

Pedal to the floor  
Thinkin' of the roar  
Gotta get us to the show

California here we come  
Right back where we started from

California!  
Here we come!"
