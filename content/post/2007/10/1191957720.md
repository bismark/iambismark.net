title: what i want out of life
---

sure, being rich and stuff would be nice, but i like to think of myself as
a pretty simple guy. here is what i really want:

1. i want to be able to always fly business class. no more being cramped
in coach.
2. i never want to have to wear a suit to work.

i think if i can do well enough in my schooling, finish at least a masters
and possible a phd, then i should be able to achieve these goals.
