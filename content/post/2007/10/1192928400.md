when saturdays are the only free day you have to do something, it WILL
rain/sleet/snow on you while you try to ride your scooter.

when you need to get to a store on a certain day because you aren't free
for the rest of the week, they WILL change their times to close an hour
earlier than their website says.

when you are trying to be healthy and sleep well, you WILL catch a cold.
probably because of the rain/sleet/snow.
