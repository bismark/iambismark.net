"Watching Terrible tv\*  
it kills all thought  
getting spacier than   
an astronaut  
making out with people   
i hardly know or like  
I can't believe what I do  
late at night.  
I wanna know what it's like  
on the inside of love.  
i'm standing at the gates   
i see the beauty above  
only when we get to see  
the aerial view  
will the patterns show  
we'll know what to do  
I know the last page so well  
i can't read the first  
so i just don't start  
it's getting worse  
i wanna know what it's like  
on the inside of love  
i'm standing at the gates  
i see the beauty above  
i wanna know what it's like  
on the inside of love  
i can't find my way in  
i try again and again  
i'm on the outside of love  
always under or above  
i cant find my way in  
i try again and again  
i'm on the outside of love  
always under or above  
must be a different view  
to be a me with a you  
i wanna know what it's like  
on the inside of love  
standing at the gates i see  
the beauty above  
i wanna know what it's like   
on the inside of love  
of course i'll be alright  
i just had a bad night.  
i just had a bad night."

\*except i am watching arrested development, which is actually pretty
good.
