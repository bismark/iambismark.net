title: a response to the board, part 2
---

see [http://theboard.byu.edu/index.php?area=viewall&id=40189][1].

much love female writers of the board. the kind words are appreciated.

krishna - see [here][2] and [here][3] and [here][4] for times that i have
extensively written for the board. what more could you possibly want!?

dragon lady - "almost thou persuadest me to be a [boardie] [again]." i do
have to chuckle every time i log into one of my credit card accounts
because the password is something along the lines of "life-long 100 hour
boardie." ah, yes, those were days. you let me know when the [official
attractive asian girl][5] is found, and then i might come back.

azriel - you are just jealous because i wouldn't watch your movie.

tangerine - careful, you might make my [sworn enemy][6] jealous. [t-shirt
designs][7] are already being made to promote the battle.
