this comic is about me:

[ride][1]

thanks jessica for sending that to me. sure, everyone makes fun of me for
buying a scooter, but i like it. admittedly, that $2600 probably could
have gotten me a car which probably would have helped me get more girls.
well, it would not have been that sweet of a car... but perhaps if i had
just mention the fact that i own a car without showing it to them, that
would at least pique their interests. nevertheless, i enjoy riding my
scooter, i enjoy only spending $3 on gas every two weeks, and i will just
have to find another way to impress girls, such as my superior
intellect.... HAH!
