apple's new ipod lineup:

http://money.cnn.com/2007/09/05/technology/apple_announcement/?postversion=2007090514

i want an ipod touch. but where is the sdk, apple? this is the newton
everyone has been begging for, and yet we have to hack it in order to
install anything! that screen is way too blank. either apple better start
churning out apps, or they had better open it up. think of the flood gates
that would open. but given that its called an ipod, i am not sure if we
will ever see it or not. please steve?

update from last time - iso t entatively rejects microsoft ooxml:

http://www.noooxml.org/

its a step, but far from over. given the amount of influence microsoft has
had so far, i could see this changing by february. be ready for an
eternity of microsoft office updates at $150 a pop.

men's housing shortage:

yup, byu approved housing is awesome, especially when they restrict
it to a two mile radius. idiotic system. i guess i am lucky i got into
where i am when i did. i wish those guys good luck.
