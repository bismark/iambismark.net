i have only added one thing to wikipedia ever. i am pretty proud of that
fact, though i doubt many people will ever read what i had to say. i like
to go back every once and awhile just to make sure its still there. is
that weird?

its to the page of william s. clark (the one i blogged about before).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William\_S.\_Clark

i added this part:

"According to the painting of the scene hanging in the former Prefectural
Capital building in Sapporo, the full quote is 'Boys, be ambitious. Be
ambitious not for money or for selfish aggrandizement, not for that
evanescent thing which men call fame. Be ambitious for that attainment of
all that a man ought to be.'"

it just makes me feel special that somewhere out there someone might read
what i wrote and learn something from it.
