i had a hard drive crash about a year and a half ago, but i've just let
the hard drive sit in my closet since then. my roommate has an ide to usb
cable, so i thought, what the heck. i plugged in the hard drive, and it
started clicking, just like when it went bad. i gave it a couple of nice
whacks with the palm of my hand, and then it started spinning up and
mounted! so i was able to get off of it a couple of old school projects
and some blogs i thought i had lost forever. sweet. i've posted the blogs
on here. all of them from january 06 and back. some have bad formatting,
but i am too tired to change them tonight. enjoy!
