i thought i would start sharing some sweet pieces of software i use. one
i found recently is called moodblast.

[http://blog.circlesixdesign.com/download/moodswing/][1]

basically, it is a status updater. it runs up in my menu bar, and i press
a hotkey, and a little text box pops up in which i type whatever i am
doing or feeling right now. i hit enter, and it sets my instant message
status, my status on this blog (see the column to the right) which is done
through twitter, and my status on facebook. i like it. its my new thing.
check it out if you have a mac.

if anyone is interested, my twitter is:
