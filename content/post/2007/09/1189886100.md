so, the hot water handle finally got fixed in our second shower (the one
i prefer) a few days ago, so i moved over all of my stuff and hopped in
there one morning. i turned on the water, and it started shooting out all
in one fat stream. it wasn't very comfortable. after my shower, i found
out what was wrong. in the shower head, there is a plastic screw with
a wide round head, which screws into the middle and pushes the water out
around it to make the water streams. this was laying on the floor. so
i stuck it in, and didn't think about it. the next morning, i got back
into the shower, and turned on the water. suddenly, this plastic screw
came firing out of the shower head really freaking fast and it hit the
ground. i am pretty sure it would have seriously hurt if it had hit me.
especially since it probably would have hit right about the level of where
guys don't like to be hit... anyway, i got it back in there, and i think
its in pretty tight, but every time i get into the shower, i am afraid of
getting shot by the plastic screw. ouch.
