Oh Daily Unifarce "editors".  You stay silent while all sorts of dribble
and idiocy is printed in the Reader's Forum.  But if someone dares to
sully the hallowed name of the greatest of all Mormons, yea even our
beloved Glenn Beck, then like the heroes you are, you rise up and set the
blasphemer's falsehoods straight.  Thank you for showing your true colors.
