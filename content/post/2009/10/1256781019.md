well, at least not in the normal sense. i am slowly transitioning away
from google services, so tonight i began moving over to a new jabber/xmpp
chat account separate from my @gmail account. if you were on my chat list
before, i tried moving you over, though i've found it had some problems.
so if you wanna chat with me through your google talk, add a new contact
with the address being ryan at the domain name of this blog (without the
www).
