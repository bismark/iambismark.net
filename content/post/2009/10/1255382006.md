ok, scratch that, comments are back (and perhaps better than ever???). so
i'm going to be using the [disqus][1] commenting system from now on. why?
well, i like comments. but i don't know if i like wordpress (security
issues, seems bloated for my needs, etc). i'm actually thinking about
rolling my own system similar to [brent simmons][2]. and disqus would work
just fine with such a solution. obviously this is just an idea i am
mulling over for now, but getting all the comments on disqus seems to have
worked easily enough. so, comment away!
