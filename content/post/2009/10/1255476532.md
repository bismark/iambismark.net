[Stephen Lynch "Vanilla Ice Cream"][1]

my friend krista sent this to me... almost describes me, but apparently
its the mexican girls i am more in to.. here are the lyrics: 

> Have a seat and listen, please don't say a thing 
> The matters of the heart sometimes, the truth will ever sting  
> Just don't take it personally, this is no attack  
> But we will never last because I am white and you are...also white  

> I only like black girls the brown girls, the café au lait  
> Caramel girls, and mocca girls just blow me away  
> If your a nubian, I want you to-be in every fantasy  
> But if you're a whitey, say nighty-nighty, your just not the girl for me

> Oh I hate vanilla ice cream, I like chocolate instead  
> I hope she likes her soul food with a little Wonder Bread  
> Don't call it Jungle Fever cause that just isn't right  
> I am not a racist, some of my best friends are white

> I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the café au lait  
> A caramel girls and mocca girls just blow me away.  
> If you're a cracker, you better get blacker or else you best get out  
> It is no mystery, I like a sister see that's what I'm talkin about 

> Our wedding song will be "Ebony and Ivory", 
> and we'll sing Christmas carols round the old Kwanzaa tree  
> But color is not the issue here, it's dignity, it's class  
> It's all about her heart, okay it's partly about that ass  

> I want me some black girl, the brown girl, the café au lait  
> A caramel girls, and mocca girls, just blow me away  
> If you're a honky, you're singin the wrong key, it's the honest truth  
> The skin that she's dwellin in, must contain melanin, that is the Fountain of Youth.

> Thomas Jefferson. 
> Robert DeNiro.  
> David Bowie. 
> To a certain extent...Ted Dansen.  
> Strom Thurmond!!! Strom Thurmond!!! 
> yeeeahh...
