so, i talked about sharing sites back in [this post][1], but i was never
really happy with my solution. thus, i've come up with a new one. now,
every time i add a link to my [delicious account][2], it will also send an
item to this site's rss feed. i don't post sites to delicious too often
and it will only give a daily digest, so it won't be filling up your rss
readers, but it will give all of you, my readers, a look into what i found
interesting during that day. enjoy!
