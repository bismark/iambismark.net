i am officially announcing the end of my support for msn/windows live
chat. having one less service just simplifies my life, and msn was always
clunky. less than 10% of my contacts still even had an msn account. so, if
you want to IM with me, please consider upgrading to google talk (or AIM
if you must). add me (remove all the spaces):

AIM: c c r y a n j

GTalk: b i s m a r k 9 0 (at) g m a i l (dot) c o m
