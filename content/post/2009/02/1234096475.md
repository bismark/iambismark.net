i went and saw gran torino with mariam yesterday afternoon.

first off, i loved it.

second off, yes it was rated r. not cuz of sex; it was squeaky clean. not
cuz of gratuitous violence; it was amazingly tame for a movie with gang
fighting as a central aspect. it was rated r because clint eastwood spoke
like a real rugged war veteran and the gang member spoke like real gang
members.
