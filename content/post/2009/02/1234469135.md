title: provo frozen yogurt smackdown 2009
---

![stores][1]

so i guess frozen yogurt became the hip thing to eat in california, etc
awhile ago and it hit here in provo sometime towards the middle of 2008.
when i got back from my internship in august, there were at least 3 new
stores opened up within about a mile of each other. usually i pay no
attention to such things as pudding on the rice is really all i need to be
happy, but mariam wanted to try something new. of course i wasn't going to
just let us go eat some crappy frozen yogurt, i wanted the best in town.
with a serious lacking of [yelpers][2] in provo, i decided i would find
out which was the best. thus was born the provo frozen yogurt smackdown of
2009.

![frozen yogurt][3]

i present to you the contenders.

so here is how it worked: at first we were going to just do the dedicated
frozen yogurt shops: provo fro-yo, yoasis, yozone, and spoon me. but then
we decided for a better sampling that we would try some stores that focus
more on ice cream but also have frozen yogurt: byu creamery, sub zero,
baskin robbins, and hogi yogi. for this to have been a really scientific
experiment, we should have gotten the same flavor at every store, but who
really wants to eat 8 different plain frozen yogurts? so we just got what
sounded good at each store. we brought them all back to mariam's apartment
and the competition began.

![snarf 4][4]

mariam had difficulty remaining objective.

i will present the results as a short paragraph about each frozen yogurt,
and at the end i will present our final rankings.

**non-frozen yogurt stores**:

_baskin robbins_:

obviously known for its ice cream. when i ordered a singe scoop sundae
with frozen yogurt, the girl looked at me all confused and i had to show
her the frozen yogurt way off in the far corner. i got it with hot fudge,
cherries, and whipped cream. this frozen yogurt was probably the most ice
cream-like of the bunch and had quite a smooth texture. both of us liked
it.

_byu creamery_:

also definitely known for its ice cream. the line was freaking long here,
apparently its the cool place to go for dates? we ordered the key lime
frozen yogurt with pineapple, but for some reason the girl gave us
coconut. it was definitely a unique flavor, and it reminded me of sherbet.

_hogi yogi_:

they make decent sandwiches, and apparently the do frozen yogurt as well.
mariam went here so i can't give any details on the in store experience.
she got chocolate with oreos mixed in. it wasn't as ice cream like as the
baskin robbins, and i thought the chocolate tasted kind of funky.

_sub zero ice cream_:

this is the place with the gimmicky making the ice cream with liquid
nitrogen thing. i guess mariam lived here last summer. she had a full
punchcard that got us a free ice cream of any size. so not wanting to pass
up the opportunity, we got the large. which apparently is enough to feed
a polygamous family. we got malt fudge chocolate with brownie mixed in. it
was definitely a better chocolate than hogi yogi's, but i recommend
sticking to their custard.

![contemplating][5]

me contemplating on the virtues of a smooth frozen yogurt.

**frozen yogurt stores**:

_provo fro-yo_:

this is the only frozen yogurt store that was around before last year.
they claim on the outside of their store to have the best frozen yogurt in
provo, which made me quite surprised to find out that they blatantly use
dreyer's frozen yogurt. we go blueberry tart with granola, and honestly it
tasted like crap.

_spoon me_:

this place is definitely the most "hip" of all the frozen yogurt stores.
it was full of pretty people and hipsters, with funky looking chairs and
pulsing music. and the price was definitely built in: $4.50 for a small.
we got the açaí with kiwi, strawberries, and nilla cookies. the yogurt
tasted quite excellent, though it was definitely one of the least creamy
of the bunch.

_yoasis_:

it took over where a donut shop used to be, which is quite a shame if you
ask me. once again mariam went here so i can't comment on the store
itself. we got plain yogurt with mango and blueberry. it was a little
creamier than spoon me, and the fruit was nice and fresh. overall a pretty
good frozen yogurt.

_yozone_:

this is one of the sell by weight frozen yogurt shops kind of like a place
called big spoon i used to go to a lot in sacramento. i liked the
atmosphere, not as pretentious feeling as spoon me. we got new york
cheesecake with strawberries and cheesecake hunks. it was excellent
tasting.

**overall results (lower is better):**

![rankings][6]

so, yes, if you are looking for good frozen yogurt, i recommend yozone.
lots of choices, a cool atmosphere, good prices, and good yogurt. but its
still not the [best dessert][7] in provo.

![snarf 3][8]

mariam in heaven.
