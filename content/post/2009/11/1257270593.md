[Put This On, Episode 1: Denim][1]

i am linking to this for my friend rachel. i think she will enjoy this
quote the most: 

> go ahead, and put them on, and wear them as hard as you can. and don't
> wash them until they stink so bad that you basically can't handle it.

i should mention that [operation levis][2] is back in force (and has been
for a few months now). my 501s are holding up strong, though i think
a second pair is in store soon. they are just really comfortable and
durable. i have started not to care about anything else. rachel, i hope
you enjoyed this little tidbit. and for everyone else, go take a look at
rachel's [etsy store][3]. she has some nice calendars.
