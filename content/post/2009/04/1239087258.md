hello again faithful blog readers. sorry i've been so terrible at keeping
this thing updated. i have been doing a lot of [microblogging][1] though,
so if you don't follow me on twitter (or if you are in the dark ages and
still don't twitter), you should do that. i've had a crazy last couple of
weeks. i'm splitting it up into a couple of entries so you can enjoy each
one at your own leisure! stuff that happened:

- [trip to wisconsin][2]
- [senior project competition][3]
- [playing with friends][4]
- realizing i'm almost done with provo! (coming soon!!)
