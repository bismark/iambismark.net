title: playing with friends
---

even with my trip to wisconsin and school craziness, i've had time to play
with friends. to celebrate my acceptance to wisconsin, michelle, ariel,
kenji, and laura went out to red lobster. i was thoroughly upset that the
all you can eat shrimp was no longer around, but it was still fun chilling
like the good old times. i really don't know why red lobster has become
a tradition for us, but now that pudding on the rice is gone, it's all
we've got.

bunch a weirdos.

michelle, ariel, and i hit up watchmen the night after. it was crazy and
long. the next day after sleeping in, michelle, ariel, and i drove up to
park city and met up with our old friend preston. we wandered around, ate
some food, checked out some shops (i really wanted to buy one of the $300
cowboy hats!!), etc. chilling with friends keeps me sane.

hello moose.

and then last weekend during my decompressing from the senior project
competition, i went on a double date with kenji. our dates were laura and
her sister. it was just fun and chill. for the first time ever i went to
the bean museum on campus. it was full of dead animals, which really made
me question it's claimed mission of promoting animal appreciation.
