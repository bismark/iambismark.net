four days after getting home from wisconsin, my senior project was due.
talk about crunch time. i dunno if i ever talked about what the project
was: we programmed a truck to autonomously navigate a course of colored
pylons. my biggest responsibility was the control and navigation of the
truck. sadly i didn't do as well as i had hoped. i made too many
assumptions about the quality of the input i would be receiving from our
vision subsystem, so the whole thing quickly turned into me hacking on
code to get it to work. i tried implementing a PID controller to get
better control over our throttle, but that just turned into a rat hole.
anyway, come day of the competition we were at least driving courses,
albeit slowly. we completed the first two courses in 4th place, but we ran
into a major snag on the fourth course. our vision couldn't detect even
the first pylon of the course! the lighting had changed in the garden
court over the day and we were driving blind. so i quickly hacked together
what i lovingly called "blind faith" mode that essentially just weaved
back and forth until it found a pylon. it actually worked and we got
a pretty awesome time! in the end we still got 4th, but it was a very
close 4th. i was happy we at least finished.
