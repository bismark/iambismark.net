so, we actually kind of took a day off on tuesday. we spent the morning at
my grandparent's house relaxing and reorganizing all the stuff we had just
quickly thrown into the back of my car. we hopped on BART to go hang out
with amy jo for the afternoon.

[12:05 PM Apr 28th][1]: enough lounging around at my grandparents. time
for a shower, then hopping on BART to eat lunch w/ @molecularbond in SF.

amy jo had just gotten done with school and we were all hungry, so she
suggest vietnamese sandwiches. i had never been, so i agreed. we hopped
back on BART to head over to the civic center to go to the sandwich shop!

[2:30 PM Apr 28th][2]: getting some Vietnamese sandwiches for lunch here
in San Francisco.

my first vietnamese sandwich experience.

[2:57 PM Apr 28th][5]: at lee's sandwiches. pulled pork was quite tasty
and they had melon milk!!

lee's was actually pretty good, and cheap. i got the bbq pork asian
sandwich, which was only $3 and quite filling. the melon milk was
a highlight though. i found the exact same stuff in a small convenience
store in a northwestern part of tokyo many years ago, and i've been
searching ever since. it was awesome. adam didn't quite know what he was
getting in to with the raw jalape√±os on the sandwich, so he just about
died.

we went back to the BART station, and amy jo said goodbye to adam for the
last time until he gets home from his mission. we headed back across the
bay to the grandparent's house. that night, my aunt, uncle, cousin, and
her bf came over for a dinner, so we had a lot of fun sitting around the
table telling family stories and then having a rousing game of wii golf.
i've never played before, but i got a double eagle, so that was pretty
cool.
