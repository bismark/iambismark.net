1) [20 Things I Learned From Tech Support][1]

at the time i saved this, i was working tech support at the college of
fine arts and communications at byu. somewhat funny, somewhat sad, but
very true.

2) [Election '08 Chart of Where the Candidates Stand][2]

well, a little political nostalgia is always fun.. i always find it
interesting to look back at these sort of things to see what we were
debating about in the past. however i am a bit sad that mr. obama hasn't
lived up to his promises (torture... wiretapping...).

3) [Cats][3]

my favorite lolcat of all time.

i saved these links on 2007.08.07.
