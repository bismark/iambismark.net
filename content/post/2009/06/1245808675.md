it's time for reciprocating a little link love to those wonderful people
who link to my blog. the following are the top ten blogs of people i know
that send people my way. but just like its wrong to barf out
a #followfriday tweet with a contextless list of names, it would be wrong
for me to share these links without explaining a little bit about them.
so, here we go:

1) [windblownandhappy.blogspot.com][1] this is my old friend sophie and
her husband morgan's blog. sophie was the roommate of my first girlfriend
at byu, but our friendship continued after the relationship didn't. she is
big into the outdoors and every time i read her blog i realize how lazy
i am for reading blogs instead of being out running.

2) [itsallyellow.blogspot.com][2] yellow is one of the head editors for
the byu [100 hour board][3]. he is also a former coworker, former
roommate, and current friend. he doesn't update this blog much anymore
because i think he is busy with other things in his life, but there are
some occasional fun posts.

3) [nataliefoell.blogspot.com][4] i met natalie at a church fireside last
summer. i don't know her too well but every time we saw each other on
campus we would say hi. and since she links to my blog, she must be cool.

4) [sushiigirl.blogspot.com][5] this is jackie's blog. jackie and i go way
back... actually i met her sister only a week or so after getting back
from my mission in japan. then when i came out to byu, i recognized the
connection and we had an awkward hello at the cereal bar in the morris
center (RIP) cafeteria. ever since then we have had various levels of
friendships, including spending two months in japan together during summer
of '07. she needs to update her blog.

5) [amycchow.blogspot.com ][6] amy is a new addition to my group of
friends! she worked with my group here at intel for the first month of
this summer and we still see her a lot her on the campus. she is hardcore
about triathlons and also makes me feel quite lazy.

6) [nanti-sarrmm.blogspot.com][7] nanti is an online acquaintance (only
met once or twice in meatspace) met through a couple of byu-related
message boards. the first was the illustrious but now lost in internet
history byu facebook network message board. we also had a number of
interactions on the still active 100 hour board [reader message board][8].

7) [brittbeelynn.blogspot.com][9] britt is another friend i met indirectly
through the 100 hour board: her sister, a current writer at the time, took
me up on [my request][10] to date writers in order to gain access to
exclusive parties. we went out for lunch, and though things didn't go
anywhere, i started hanging out with her and her sister.

8) [canuckette.blogspot.com][11] eileen is anther friend from those
freshman days long past spent in deseret towers. we met, i swooned, and
i asked her on a date. didn't go anywhere except that i found out she was
a totally cool girl and we have been "internet" friends ever since. she
plays world of warcraft, which means we can forgive her for being
canadian.

9) [chillygator.blogspot.com][12] chilly is one of those people who
apparently knows everyone. in fact, most of you reading this probably
already read her blog. we met through some mutual friends and quickly
became close pals. i even spent this last weekend hanging out with her in
san francisco. anyway, go check out her blog at least for her cool
photography.

10) [tismabel.blogspot.com][13] mabel and i were in _hello dolly_
together. we spent the rest of the spring and summer of '07 having crazy
times with the gang. her blogs have been lacking lately...

ok, hope you enjoy some of these blogs! and btw, for those of you with
blogger based blogs who use the blog feed sidebar widget: i think you need
to put my RSS feed in again since google screwed everything up with the
feedburner conversion. though, i guess if your blog has the wrong RSS
feed, you probably aren't reading this anyway... explains my 50% drop in
readers...
