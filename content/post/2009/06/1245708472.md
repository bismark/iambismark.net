i've decided delicious.com really isn't all the worthwhile to me. i don't
use it for backup and keeping around old links really doesn't seem all
that important with the power of google and local bookmarks (of which of
course i keep both local and remote backups). for a while i was using
delicious.com as a way to share links with small comments on them with
people. but i realized this really wasn't all that great of an idea, since
it wasn't possible to comment on those posts! so, i've decided to clear
out my delicious.com account and shut it down. i enjoy consolidating my
online presence, and this is just one step of many that i have been taking
(perhaps more on that later). but it seems a waste to just let the 100 or
so links i've saved over time just disappear into internet history. so,
i am going to start writing posts with a few of those shared links at
a time. i will include both original comments (if there were any) and new
comments that i have on links that i am now revisiting.
