i dunno why i wanted to go to death valley, i suppose its not a normal
route people take and it was a pretty big loop to take from bakersfield to
las vegas (unfortunately the tioga pass on the east side of yosemite was
closed still and that would have cut out a lot). something about it just
intrigued me. we decided to head out early thursday morning so that we
could get into the park as early as possible.

for some reason we had a bit of trouble getting out of bakersfield, stupid
morning traffic. but once we hit the interstate, it was a smooth, but
rather boring, driving. lots of brown hills quickly turning into desert.

{{< image 1 >}}Getting jerky in the desert{{< /image >}}

i saw some signs for "good jerky" so i figured we would stop to try it
out. i thought it was pretty special stuff that was only found out on the
edge of death valley, but actually i saw the exact same store in arizona
so i was kind of annoyed. the jerky was decent though.

> heading in to death valley.
 
things kept getting more and more desolate heading into the park. it
wasn't extremely hot and we were fine driving with our windows down. once
we got over the mountain ridge, the downhill into the valley was pretty
fun to drive. basically a straight downhill shot for a long long way.
i got up to 65 mph without hitting the gas.

here is a view of some of the sand dunes that first come into view going
into the valley. but that was just the beginning of the desert.

the picture doesn't quite do justice to the scene. the road was on a long
downhill still and the valley floor seemed far below the sign.

{{< image 4 >}}20 mule borax wagons{{< /image >}}

apparently death valley was a major source of borax back in the day, and
the 20 mule brand comes from the 20 mule wagons that would take the mined
borax out of the valley and to the closest railroad station. i can't
believe what it would be like to be standing out on that valley floor
scraping rock from the surface.

one thing that is kind of jolting is furnace creek. its a little patch of
green in the middle of the desert surrounding a spring. the visitors
center was there and so is a little ranch/hotel. the place was _packed_
with germans. actually, the entire trip was full of run ins with germans.
must have been a german holiday that week?? after a quick lunch stop at
furnace creek, we decided to head down to badwater, the lowest place in
the western hemisphere. it got hotter and the air heavier the further down
we drove.

{{< image 5 >}}Sign that shows sea level{{< /image >}}

this picture is pretty awesome it think. slightly right of the center
about 1/3 of the way down on the picture is a small sign on the side of
the rock. that's showing were sea level is.

{{< image 6 >}}Me at lowest point in western hemisphere{{< /image >}}

this is me hanging out at badwater. amazingly there was a small brine pond
filled with some small animals and bugs beneath my feet. it was hot and
i felt like i was being pushed down on my shoulders from the air pressure.

{{< image 7 >}}Adam at painted rocks{{< /image >}}

on our way back from badwater we drove up through the artist's canyon.
some really pretty vistas and mineral formations. once we were done there,
we just felt hot and tired, so we decided to get out of the valley.

this is the last view we had of some of the amazing scenery in death
valley.

[6:00 PM Apr 30th][13]:

> valley got quite hot esp. at badwater. now on towards vegas.
 
the drive to las vegas was without incident.

[6:25 PM Apr 30th][14]:

> anyone have a recommendation for a cheap but decent place to eat in
> vegas?

adam's friend's family let us borrow a room for the night, so stopped
there to drop off all of our stuff. we then decided to go check out the
strip to see what it was all about. let's just say, i wasn't impressed.

[8:54 PM Apr 30th][15]:

> vegas: full of glitz, absolutely no substance. lots of lights, lots of
> glamour, but just all fake and tacky.
  
we walked around inside the bellagio a bit then wandered up and down the
strip. apparently we missed some of the more exciting things, but i didn't
care. compared to the amazing places we had seen over the past two days,
none of the fake glitz could impress me. the packed sidewalks lined by
dudes slapping their prostitute flyers together and then shoving them in
our faces got pretty old quick. we did want some food though, but we
decided that the dinner buffets were too expensive. instead we found
a sandwich shop inside one of the casinos. we were sitting next to some
slots so i figured it would have been a waste to not at least tried it out
once.

[9:56 PM Apr 30th][16]:

> gave myself $1 on the quarter slots. all gone in 5 spins. sigh, guess
> I'm just not cut out to be a high roller.

so yeah, lost pretty quick. i actually wish i would have printed out the
ticket when i had a quarter left and taken it up to the booth to cash it.
too bad.
