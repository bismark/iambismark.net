these are the first four bookmarks that i saved on delicious.com and
i want to [share them now][1]:

1) [10 ways to entertain young children for $1 or less (without the
TV)][2]

i dunno why i saved this... maybe i thought i would be having kids at
sometime in the near future? maybe someone will enjoy it.

2) [Approaching Mormon Doctrine][3]

i saved this link during the doctrinal debates that followed the dick
cheney visit and the student protests at byu. the arguments evolved into
many directions: whether or not the byu board of trustees was divinely
inspired and how much weight we should place in church leaders' political
opinions. this was an official source i used to back up my viewpoints.

3) [Brigham Young University: A House of Faith -- Standards & the Honor
Code][4]

another link based on theological debate: discussing the divine
inspiration of the byu board of trustees also led to debating the origins,
purposes, and religious significance of the byu honor code. this book
chapter was quite revealing.

4) [Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch Station
Sign][5]

apparently this sign has the longest city name in the world. sweet.

i saved these links on 2007.07.29.
