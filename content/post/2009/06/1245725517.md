_ok, time to polish these bad boys off._ we were planning on eating at
a casino buffet for breakfast but adam's friend made us pancakes before we
even woke up. someday.. after the quick breakfast, we set off towards the
grand canyon. this drive actually took quite a bit longer than
i originally planned for some reason. the scenery along the way was quite
ugly and it was a pretty long and lame drive.

![Me at the Hoover Dam][1]

the one cool thing was the hoover dam along the way. well, cool except for
the part when the department of the interior made us pay $7 to park and
then wanted us to pay $8 more a person just for the tour. we opted to just
look around the outside.

i guess they are building a bridge across the gorge. this was actually
pretty cool. the drive to kingman was depressingly bland, and then on
through to the grand canyon was about the same.

[3:30 PM May 1st][3]:

> just arrived at the grand canyon.

i wanted to arrive closer to about 1 pm because 3:30 pm left us with only
a few hours before we needed to be back on the road. but what short amount
of hiking we got to do was quite amazing.

[6:15 PM May 1st][4]:

> it's really pretty here.

here are a few pics. sadly the iphone camera once again fails to do the
view justice.

we took a bus ride down about 2 miles west along the rim and hiked back to
the parking lot. i loved the view and i am adding this to one more place
i need to spend a week at.

[7:02 PM May 1st][11]:

> leaving grand canyon. five hour drive now to Blythe CA. sounds like
> a terribly exciting place.

so we made the decision to make it as far as possible that night so we
would have less driving to do on saturday. we picked blythe and set off
for the long journey back west.

[10:18 PM May 1st][12]:

> leaving kingman. a couple more hours left to go till Blythe and sleep.

adam got us to kingman, and i took over from there. driving through the
deserts of southern california while dead tired is not usually the best
idea. since its almost two months ago, i think its safe to say i almost
killed us both on this drive because of my fatigue. quite a few wild
animals running across the highway too.

> just pulled into the Blythe CA motel 6. gosh I'm tired out.
