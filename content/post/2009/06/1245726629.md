this is the joy of driving through the desert at night... a few car washes
later, this mostly is still caked on... woke up probably too early on
saturday to head out for san diego. in the full sunlight i was able to see
that blythe CA and surrounding areas were probably more bland than the
drive through arizona..

this was about the only interesting scenery along the way. miles of sand
dunes, with tons of dirt bikes and four wheelers. kind of fun to watch.
the air got smellier from the cattle "farms" and the ratio of english to
spanish radio stations quickly slanted towards the latter as we drove
south.

[12:45 PM May 2nd][5]: eating at a hole in the wall mexican restaurant
called camancho's place in el centro.

it was recommended by yelp. we had lunch [here][6], which actually wasn't
too bad. didn't think it was the most amazing mexican food i'd ever had,
but what do i know, i'm just a gringo. the drive to san diego was hot and
longer than i expect. very mountainous. border patrol waived us through
pretty quickly, though i am not sure why i had to be stopped for
interstate travel... stupid at&t decided to text message me when we were
at the closest place to the border. they said i was entering the
international service rate area, and of course they charged me the
international text message fee for it. didn't feel like disputing the $1
charge. i started getting pretty tired again as we were finally getting
over the mountains and heading down into the coast. i decided we better
take a rest at the motel before we tried to do anything else.

[5:05 PM May 2nd][7]: wandering down along pacific beach in san diego.

sadly it's overcast and almost a bit chilly. we went out to walk along
pacific beach. not a ton of people since it was overcast, but it was
a nice walk.

[5:27 PM May 2nd][10]: some lady is walking in on the boardwalk in a wet
suit and heels. it's entertaining to see all the reactions of people as
they pass.

i got some tacos along the boardwalk (cuz i figured that was the thing to
do) and then both adam and i realized just how worn out from the trip we
were. we decided to just relax and go see the wolverine movie (which was
absolutely horrible.... too bad i didn't write this earlier to warn
everyone..). after the movie we just crashed in the hotel room.
