sunday morning i dropped off adam early at the airport for his flight
home. afterwards i decided to sleep in until i had to check out just
because i was so worn out from the previous week. at noon i started my
long trip north. first i decided to stop by the san diego temple grounds.
to be honest, it was smaller than i had imagined. pretty though. then
i made the dumbest decision ever: i thought it would be cool to take
highway 1 up the coast. just to finish off my drive with some pretty
views. well, reader beware: don't get on the 1 until you are well north of
los angeles. took me hours to get out of that mess. i finally got north of
it all and started enjoying the drive along the coast, but then sadly
i started hitting fog. by sunset, i barely had any visibility and i missed
out on the view. it was getting late, so i stopped at morro bay for the
night. motel 6 certainly made a killing from me over that week.

[10:02 PM May 3rd][1]: stopping in morro bay for the night. been a really
pretty drive up the 1. on to monterrey and the bay area tomorrow. one week
of driving!

the next morning the fog was sadly still around. i tried to check out
morro rock, but only was able to see a small hunk of it. i hoped that the
fog would burn off as the day went on so i continued north.

[10:21 AM May 4th][2]: well, i'm all out of clean clothes. i guess
i better end my road trip now. up the coast to monterey, santa cruz, then
into the bay area.

i got glimpses here and there of clear sky, but most of the way was foggy,
which was quite disappointing since i know the views would have been
amazing.

one of the few times i was able to see through the fog.

[12:34 PM May 4th][5]: elephant seals battling on the shore!

i came up on one of the elephant seal beaches and stopped to watch for
a bit. it was pretty fun.

[12:52 PM May 4th][8]: well they stopped now. here is a bunch of them though.

the drive up through monterey and to santa cruz was nice but uneventful.

[3:49 PM May 4th][9]: eating at charlie hong kongs in santa cruz. chow
mein with spicy beef. yum.

i started hitting traffic coming up through san jose, but i finally made
it to my grandparents house in time for dinner. this was a pretty epic
road trip, and i am really glad i was able to do it. hanging out with the
little bro for the last time before he goes on the mission was cool, and
we saw some pretty amazing places along the way. next time i plan on
spending much more time at each one and also taking a nicer camera. and
now i can finally start writing in my blog again without feeling guilty
for not finishing these posts! :D
