ok, so for those of you who just read my blog posts in your RSS
newsreader, you probably have not noticed that i have undertaken in some
cosmetic and layout changes on my blog. these are certainly works in
progress (basically just me fiddling around with CSS to see what happens)
and a much larger makeover is planned hopefully in the near future. as
i add new features and content, i will write posts about them.

additionally, i have now turned off all comments on my blog. this is in
now way meant to stifle any discussion; it is meant to encourage it.
however, if you want to respond to something i write, i encourage you to
write a response post on your own blog. my philosophy on blogs has been
evolving, and i feel like any good discussion on a post i write would just
get lost in the comments section if left there. posting a response on your
own blog (or if you do not have one, writing an email with permission for
me to repost it and respond) allows for a much more open discussion.
actually my next post is going to be in response to a lengthy comment
i received a few days ago.
