i want to be a more charitable person. i've been blessed with so much,
what little i give back is pretty shameful. in all my reading about
frugality and living within my means, i came to the realization that when
i am using my money correctly, that gives me a better opportunity to help
other people out (which certainly includes my current and future family).
anyway, i am sharing this not to toot my horn, but just in case anyone
else is interested in helping too: i made my first donation to kiva.org.
its a micro-lending site where you can give out loans to help people in
third world countries start businesses and improve their lives. here is
who i donated to: [Baltazari Ngowi][1] i didn't really search for anyone
too particular, i just grabbed one of the people off of the front page and
made a small donation. i will get my portion of the loan back within
a year, after which i can then lend the money to someone else. its a cool
concept, and i really like how personal it is. i hope this is just the
start for me of being a more charitable person.
