1) [What are the top ten things every BYU freshman should do their 1st year at the Y?][1]

i think i originally saved this as a link to send to my little bro before
he came out to byu... not sure if i ever actually gave it to him or not.
but it's always good to give a shout out to [the board][2], the fine group
of people who supplied me with friends, dates, girlfriends, mortal
enemies, roommates, free food, blog readers, and crocheting lessons over
most of my byu career. my relationship with the board is mostly on
personal levels with current and former writers, though bismark does still
make an occasional appearance. a list of every single question i ever
asked can be found [here][3], ironically on a blog post where i announced
i was cutting off ties with the website (as the astute reader will see,
many of the questions linked were asked after that post was originally
written... old habits die hard). anyway, somewhat humorous list of things
freshman should do at byu. enjoy!

i saved this on 2007.08.13.
