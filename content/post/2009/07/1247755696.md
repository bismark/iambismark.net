[BYU Alternative Commencement Speech 2007 - Ashley Sanders][1]

whether or not you agree with the things ashley said in this speech, its
hard to not place this as one of the defining moments of the most
interesting thing that happened at byu at least while i was there. the
furor over the dick cheney visit died down quickly, and sadly so did much
of the discussion and debate. i remember spending hours a day sitting on
facebook discussion boards going back and forth over doctrinal and
political topics. it was actually a pretty exciting time to be at byu, it
made me feel like we were on a college campus.
