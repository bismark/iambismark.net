[Ulli's Roy Orbison in Cling-film site][1]

i'm pretty sure this is the weirdest thing i saved... my sister sent it to
me for some reason, and it is just... wow. aside from being rather
disturbing, the stories are quite hilarious. here is a quote from [story
one][2]:

> I am in the garden airing my terrapin Jetta when he walks past my gate,
> that mysterious man in black. 'Hello Roy,' I say. 'What are you doing in
> Dusseldorf?' 'Attending to certain matters,' he replies. 'Ah,' I say. He
> apprises Jetta's lines with a keen eye. 'That is a well-groomed
> terrapin,' he says.

so weird, so funny.

i saved this on 2007.08.25.
