so my mom sent me a couple of books about personal finance, debt,
budgeting, etc. it was part of my graduation gift to help me start being
more financially responsible. actually i am pretty decently responsible
now... i have no debt coming out of my undergrad, i pay off my credit card
balance in full each month, and i have a bit of savings put aside.
granted, its not as much as it should be (i like to eat out way way too
much), but i'm working on it. anyway, since reading these books i've been
thinking a lot more about how to make better use of my finances. one
message i really enjoyed from the book _[i will teach you to be rich][1]_
is to automate and simplify things. if i am doing it right, i can make my
money work for me instead of just being something i give away to others.

so i've started automatically putting money into a liquid savings account
and into a roth IRA investment account (sexy, i know, but sorry ladies,
i'm taken). while i highly respect my friend [tianna][2] for being
hardcore about finding bargains and couponing, i am not at a place in my
life right now that i want to be investing that sort of time. the way
i see it, since i am getting paid around $30 an hour at intel, my free
time is worth almost double that to me. i would have to save at least $60
an hour by bargain hunting at various grocery stores for me to feel like
it is worth it right now. and since i am not big into cooking at home or
trying out new recipes, its just not my thing. so i found a different way
to save myself some money, though now that that the initial research is
done, it will take me all of 10 seconds a day. i've decided to optimize my
use of credit cards! "now wait ryan," you might say, "credit cards are
bad!" and its true, in many cases credit cards can be bad bad things. but
for someone who has always used credit cards responsibly, i've figured out
a way to save a few hundred dollars a year just by using the right card.
so how will i do it? well, i found a combination of three credit cards
that earn me some pretty sweet rewards. i calculate i will average at
least 3% cashback for all my purchases. of course this means i always have
to pay the balance in full each month. just one card that accrues interest
will wipe out a good hunk of those rewards. "but ryan, isn't keeping track
of three cards also using up a lot of your free time???" the thing is,
i already keep meticulous financial records. i save every single receipt
and i actually really enjoy marking off each one as i enter it into my
budget program. since its almost like a hobby to me, i might as well make
the most of it! so, here are the cards:

my first card and what i plan to use for my main spending is the true
earnings american express card from costco. i've been wanting a costco
membership for awhile now (love the pizza!!) so this seemed like a good
way to kill two birds with one stone. this card gives me 3% back on gas
purchases at costco, which is pretty awesome. costco's gas is usually
about 7% cheaper than most gas stations, so that's a good 10% savings!
with gas hovering near $3 here in california, $.30 off of a gallon is
pretty sweet. the card also gives me 3% back on restaurants (my vice), 2%
back on travel, and 1% back everywhere else.

my next card which i will use for "everyday purchases" is the associated
bank cash rebates visa card (thats not actually it in the picture.. the
card is kind of a secret!!). this card gives me 5% (!!) back on gas,
groceries, and drugstores. niiiiice. associated bank is a small bank in
northern wisconsin, but they put out this card through citi. this is what
i will use to buy groceries with and pay for gas anytime i am not near
a costco.

my final card is the citi mtvu visa card. i am going to keep this card for
two reasons: 1) it gives me 5 points per dollar spent at restaurants,
which is nice for places that don't take american express. 2) it gives me
5 points per dollar spent at book and movie stores (including all amazon
and itunes purchases!). the reason this card is not as great is because,
as mentioned, it is a reward points card, not a cash back card like the
other two. that means in order for me to get rebates, i need to earn
a certain number of points and then exchange them for a check. and of
course points dont have a 1:1 exchange rate. but if i use this card for
just those 5x purchases, the card will yield around 3% cash back for both.

so there you have it, my trio of cards that are going to earn me a few
hundred dollars in cash back savings just by me using them like i've been
using my debit card this whole time (another bonus from this: i keep my
money in my interest making savings account for the entire month until
i pay off the card). and all i have to change from my current routine is
to make a 1 second decision at the cash register of which card is the
right one to use!
