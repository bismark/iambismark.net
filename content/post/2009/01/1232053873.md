i think a lot of you are coming over from the blogger world. blogger is
nice for how well it plays with other google stuff, but thats really about
it as far as good reasons to use blogger if you ask me. but since my
switch over into the wonderful world of wordpress, i've missed one thing:
commenter [avatars][1]. well, now i've figured out how to get them
working! in non-blogger world, people are big into interoperability
outside of just google. one of the neat ideas is a global avatar system
that allows a person to have the same avatar across all blogs and website.
wordpress has out of the box support for [gravatars][2] (stands for
**g**lobally **r**ecognized **avatar**). basically you create an account
with your email address and it links the avatar with that address. then
every time you comment on a blog using that email address, it will display
your avatar. so, for you people who have started commenting on my blog,
please go grab yourself a gravatar and represent yo self!
