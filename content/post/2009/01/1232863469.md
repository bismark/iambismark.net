- ability for apps to access exif data on pictures to allow for real
  direct upliading to flickr.
- 3rd party wired syncing so that all of my apps will sync when i plug in
  the phone instead of having to get on the wifi and open up each app to
  sync.
- inter-app communications. if i post a picture in my flickr app i want to
  be able to post it on my wordpress blog and my twitted feed. whether
  this is through copy and paste or what, i don't care.
