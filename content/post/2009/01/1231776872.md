so if you haven't noticed, i'm on kind of a mint/menthol kick lately.
[first][1] was the american crew citrus mint shampoo/conditioner,
[then][2] came the menthol gold bond powder. now i have mint soap!! i've
been needing some new soap lately. i really liked my last two bars. i had
a crabtree & evelyn aloe bar during the summer to help with my
[sunburn][3], and after that i used the geo f. trumper spice body bar that
they sent me with a shaving sampler. btw, i wasn't impressed with their
shaving stuff, even the much vaunted skin food, but the soap was actually
quite nice. since it was almost out, i was doing some research on new
soaps, and i was torn between some [nancy boy soap][4] and some
[mitchell's wool fat soap][5]. but then on saturday mariam and i stopped
by one of those mall shops with all of the girly smelly lotions and
i noticed they had a section of c.o. bigelow men's products. i was pretty
"eh" about the shaving stuff, but the [mentha soap][6] caught my eye!
i picked up a bar and i love it. it makes my morning shower quite exciting
and i feel tingly all over for quite some time. add that to the gold bond
powder and i am wide awake by the end of my morning routine. now my only
concern is smelling like a candy cane.

**edit**: i now see that nancy boy also has a mint soap. i think i will
try that next to compare!
