title: Markdown Macros in MarsEdit
---

I have decided to move over to [tumblr][1] for my blogging needs (more on
this later). tumblr supports writing posts in [Markdown][2], which I have
come to appreciate as a nice way of writing text.  For writing posts,
I use [MarsEdit][3], which even has a built in Markdown filter to give me
a preview of how things will look.

Mowever, the default markup macros output HTML.  Seemed a little
pointless, so I decided to change the macros to output Markdown, making my
writing much nicer... here is what I came up with:

* add link opening:	

        [
	
* add link closing:
	
        ](#askurl Add Link:#)

* paste link opening:
		
        [

* paste link closing:

        ](#pasteurl#)

* bold opening and closing:

        **

* italics opening and closing:

		*

* preformatted:

        \t (aka a tab)

* line break:

        \s\s\n (aka two spaces and a newline)

* paragraph opening:

        \n #selected text# (aka a new line then the text)

* paragraph closing:

        \n\n

    (aka two new lines)

* blockquote:

        > #selection#

* code opening:

        ` #selected text#

* code closing:

        `

* h1 opening:

        # #selected text#

* h1 closing:

         #

(for the other headers, just add more `#` to the opening and closing)

Pretty basic.. I've considered the possibility of writing Applescripts to
convert selections to lists, etc. I might use [this][4] as a guide.
