I would be truly remiss if I let 2009 close without my annual gratitude
post. Thanksgiving and this holiday break have been quite busy, spending
all of my free time with Mariam.  But she is currently sleeping upstairs,
so I will take these few moments to say what I was grateful for this year:  

- sappy blogs written at 9 AM in northern Mexico  
- Mariam
- learning to respect myself again
- new friends and new adventures
- Levi's
- my mom's packing skills
- grading curves
- space heaters
- old friends and new adventures
- my testimony
- the diplomatic power of cheese
- credit cards
- the Madison police department
- mission journals
- road trips and little brothers to drive while I nap
- the awesomeness of nature    
- webcams
- God
- mousetraps
- knowing I can be better today than I was yesterday
- real love
- life
