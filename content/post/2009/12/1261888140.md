[Donor's Choose][1]

Thanks to a suggestion from my sister, this has been me and my family's
charity of choice this Christmas.  It is a pretty cool site: teachers in
impoverished areas post requests for school projects and classes and
donors can choose one to fund.  Education has always been very important
to me so I was excited when I heard about it. This is the project
I decided to fund:  

[Do You See What I See?][2]

Reading through the request, I was reminded of the excitement that
scientific discovery brought me as a child. I hope that my small donation
can help bring that to some other children.  My parents used a gift card
my sister and I gave them to purchase books for a local high school. There
are projects of all types all over the country to choose from.  

This is a donation instead of a loan like Kiva, so I won't be getting this
money back. But I think education is actually a great long term
investment. The more quality education we can have in this country, the
better our economy will run. Education is fundamental to a prosperous
society. If you feel the same, I hope you will also donate to a project
that means something to you.
