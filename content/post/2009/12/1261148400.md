[Archive][1]

My blog archive is now up, though in a very... raw state. It was generated
by a python script I whipped up yesterday afternoon.  I still need to
cleanup a few of the source files and add some css, but at least it's
there. 

I also fixed my .htaccess so that any links to the old permalink style
will work with the new ones. ex:

[http://www.iambismark.net/2009/12/06/my-girl/][2]

now redirects to:

[http://www.iambismark.net/archive/2009/12/06/my-girl.html][3]

[1]: {{< ref "archive/" >}}
[2]: http://www.iambismark.net/2009/12/06/my-girl/
[3]: http://www.iambismark.net/archive/2009/12/06/my-girl.html
