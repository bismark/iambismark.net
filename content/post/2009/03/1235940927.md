while i was doing my taxes, i took a look at how much money i supposedly
made last year and then how much money i have in the bank. yeah, for some
reason there was a huge discrepancy there. looking over my last years
spending reports, i am quite certain that a huge hunk of that money went
towards eating out (compounded by the fact that for a good majority of the
year i was paying for two people each time), so i decided to greatly cut
down the number of meals i buy at a restaurant. honestly this is pretty
tough for me, because i always feel like i'm too busy to cook and i rarely
feel like the things i make taste all that good. but at the encouragement
of my mother, i made the commitment. right now my goal is to only eat out
on fridays and saturdays. thats four days and thus 8-12 meals eaten out
fewer than before. this going to save me a ton of money and hopefully help
me shed a few of those soft spots that tend to pop up throughout the
semester. i don't have some great plan on how this is all going to work,
but yesterday i went on a big $75 grocery trip. for pretty much the first
time ever, i actually made a shopping list, which is a first for me. i got
a lot of good food that i am actually excited about eating. so today was
day one with my filled cupboards. this morning i decided to use a bag of
lentils that i first purchased back towards the beginning of my
internship. yes, i carried these lentils with me for the last year and
across two states (just some proof as to how little i actually cooked).
i got some tips from my mom and i threw together a lentil stew in the
crock pot my mom sent me last year (which i've never used before today).
i put in a can of diced tomatoes, a can of chicken broth, the bag of
lentils, some sauteed carrots and onions, spicy turkey sausage, and some
spices i borrowed from my roommate. i let it cook for about 7 hours, and
i'm proud to say it tasted quite excellent.

the finished product (like i said, the crock pot is from my mom.. ignore
the flower pattern). after dinner, i decided to try out [this recipe][3]
for breakfast burritos that my mom sent me a few days ago. here is how it
went:

here are all of the ingredients i got together. i decided to cut the
recipe by 3/4 just to give it a shot for the week. 

[![Chopped peppers][6]][7]

first i chopped up half of the green pepper.

second i friend them a bit in some butter. 

[![Eggs][10]][11]

then i broke the eggs and mixed in some pepper and milk.

i beat the eggs. 

[![Rinsed beans][14]][15]

next i drained and rinsed the can of black beans. 

[![Fried eggs][16]][17]

i scrambled the eggs with the peppers and butter already in the pan.

\*ryan's tip for scrambled eggs: the less you stir the eggs, the fluffier
and more moist they will be. if you just stir the constantly, they get all
dry and crumbly. i lift up one side, tilt the pan so the raw egg flows
underneath, rotate the pan, and repeat until done. learned this on my
mission.

once the eggs were done i added the beans and mixed them all together. 

[![Tortilla][20]][21]

then i laid out a burrito tortilla on a piece of plastic wrap. 

[![Filled tortilla][22]][23]

i filled it with the egg mix, salsa, and some cheese. then i rolled it up
and wrapped the plastic around it. my first one messed up pretty bad
because the tortilla broke, and i realized it was because the tortillas
were cold. i stuck them in the microwave for a bit, and the rest went
quite smoothly. 

[![Finished product][24]][25]

i ended up with six burritos (not quite the eight that should have come
from a fourth of the recipe). the sizes varied a bit, so i will find out
what's too big and what's too little. all of the burritos are now stacked
in my freezer, and i will let you all know how good they end up being for
breakfast!
